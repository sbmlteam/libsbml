<h2><a class="anchor" name="quick">Quick start instructions</a></h2>

<p> If you are using the Xerces XML library, beware there is a known
bug in Xerces 2.6.0 that cannot be worked around at this time and
causes errors in software using it.  Xerces versions 2.2 - 2.5 and
2.7.0 are known to work properly.  We recommend Xerces 2.7.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="quick-unix">Linux, MacOS&nbsp;X, and Solaris</a></h3>

<p> At a shell (terminal) command prompt, untar the distribution, cd
into the directory thereby created (e.g., <code>libsbml-2.4</code>),
and first type:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure
</pre></div>

<p> If you do not have the Xerces-C++ XML library on your system, the
configure step will fail.  In that case, you can try using the Expat
or libxml libraries instead.  For Expat, use

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-expat
</pre></div>

<p>
and for libxml, use

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-libxml
</pre></div>

<p> By default, libSBML only builds the C and C++ API library.  If you
want to configure libSBML to build the Java, Python, Perl, Lisp and/or
MATLAB API libraries as well, add the flags <code>--with-java</code>,
<code>--with-python</code>, <code>--with-perl</code>,
<code>--with-lisp</code> and/or <code>--with-matlab</code> to the
configure command.  You can combine options.

<p> Depending on your system, you may need to tell the configure
program where to find some of these extra components by adding a
directory path after the option.  For example, if you wish to use a
copy of Java whose components are in <code>/usr/local</code> (with
files in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>), use

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-expat --with-python --with-java=/usr/local
</pre></div>

<p> Once you've successfully configured libSBML, run the following two
commands to build and install it:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make
  make install
</pre></div>

<p> To compile C or C++ programs that use libSBML with GCC, use a
command such as the following, where <code>-lsbml</code> tells the
compiler to link with the installed libSBML library:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  gcc -o myapp.c myapp.c -lsbml
</pre></div>

<p> If the compiler cannot find the library, refer to the <a
href="#accessing">section on accessing libSBML</a> below for
information about <code>ldconfig</code>,
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>/<code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, and
related matters.

<p> Documentation for libSBML is available as a separate download from
the same locations as the libSBML distribution (namely, the SBML
project on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71971">SourceForge</a>
and the <a href="http://sbml.org/software/libsbml"
target="libSBML">SBML.org website</a>).  You may also regenerate the
documentation from the source code distribution if you have <a
href="http://doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> version 1.4.5 installed and have
configured libSBML with the <code>--with-doxygen</code> flag.  Then
you can execute the following to generate and install the AP
documentation files:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make install-docs
</pre></div>

Please see the section <a href="#docs">Generating documentation</a>
below for more information.



<h3><a class="anchor" name="quick-windows">Windows</a></h3>

<p> We should point out at the outset that the main developers have been
using only Windows XP, and do not have direct experience building libSBML
under other versions of Windows.  Users do report some success on other
versions of Windows, but your mileage may vary.

<p> Download and run the self-extracting windows installer for
libSBML.  There are debug (<code>libsbmld</code>) and release
(<code>libsbml</code>) versions of libSBML, with <code>.dll</code> and
<code>.lib</code> files for both versions in the
<code>win32/bin</code> subdirectory of the libSBML distribution.
Header files are located in the subdirectory
<code>win32/include/sbml</code>.

<p> Users of Visual C++ should make their Visual C++ projects link
with the files <code>libsbml.lib</code> or <code>libsbmld.lib</code>
and generate code for the Multithreaded DLL or Debug Multithreaded DLL
version of the VC++ runtime, respectively.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="detailed">Detailed instructions for configuring and installing LibSBML</a></h2>

<p> LibSBML requires a separate XML library for low-level XML
tokenizing and Unicode support.  As of libSBML 3.0, it supports the
Xerces-C++, Expat, and libXML XML libraries on Linux, Windows,
MacOS&nbsp;X and Solaris.  Many Linux systems provide one or more of
these libraries either as part of their standard distribution or as an
optional RPM, Debian, Mandrake or other package.  For more
information, see <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/</a>
for Xerces, <a href="http://expat.sf.net">http://expat.sf.net</a> for
Expat, and <a href="http://xmlsoft.org">http://xmlsoft.org</a> for
libxml2.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="basic-config">Configuring for Linux, MacOS&nbsp;X, and Solaris</a></h3>

<p> If you have obtained the libSBML source code distribution, then at
your Linux, MacOS&nbsp;X or Solaris command prompt, unpack the
distribution, cd into the directory created (e.g.,
<code>libsbml-2.4.0</code>), and type the following command in a terminal
shell window to configure libSBML for your system:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure
</pre></div>

<p> To specify Expat or libxml2 explicitly rather than the libSBML
default of Xerces, use a command such as the following instead:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-expat
</pre></div>
or 
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-libxml
</pre></div>

<p> If your Expat, Xerces or libxml2 is installed in a non-standard
location on your computer system (e.g., a private home directory),
<code>configure</code> may not be able to find it by itself.  In this
case, <code>configure</code> needs to be told explicitly where to find
the libraries.  Use the following forms:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-expat="DIR"
</pre></div>
or
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-xerces="DIR"
</pre></div>
or
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-libxml="DIR"
</pre></div>

<p> where DIR is the parent directory of where the
<code>include</code> and <code>lib</code> directories of Xerces, Expat
or libxml2 (whichever one you are trying to use) is located.  For
example, on MacOS&nbsp;X, if you used <a
href="http://finkproject.org">Fink</a> to install Expat in Fink's
default software tree, you would configure libSBML using the following
command:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-xerces="/sw"
</pre></div>

<p> During the installation phase (i.e., when running <code>make
install</code>, discussed below), the default libSBML installation
commands will copy header files to <code>
/usr/local/include/sbml</code>, the (shared and static) library files
to <code>/usr/local/lib</code>, and documentation files in various
formats to <code>/usr/local/share/doc/libsbml-VERSION</code>, by
default.  To specify a different installation location, use the <code>
--prefix</code> argument to configure.  For example,

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --prefix="/my/favorite/path"
</pre></div>

<p> Of course, you can combine the flags to configure, giving both
<code>--prefix</code> and <code>--with-expat</code> or
<code>--with-xerces</code> or <code>--with-libxml</code> to set both
options.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="other-lang">Configuring interfaces to Java, Lisp, Perl, Python and MATLAB</a></h3>

<p> LibSBML's core is written in C and C++, but libSBML comes with
APIs for other languages as well.  To enable the library extensions
for Java, Python, Lisp and MATLAB, you need to supply additional
options to <code>configure</code>.  These options are
<code>--with-java</code>, <code>--with-perl</code>,
<code>--with-python</code>, <code>--with-lisp</code>, and
<code>--with-matlab</code>.  As with other configure options, these
take an optional prefix argument; for example,

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-java="DIR"
</pre></div>

<p>
If you want to build multiple language bindings for libSBML, combine
multiple flags together as in the following example:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-java --with-python
</pre></div>

<p> The libSBML distribution ships with certain interface files provided,
so that you do not need to have the software necessary to recreate them.
However, if you obtained the libSBML distribution from CVS or want to
recreate the files deliberately, you may need to configure libSBML to use
SWIG to regenerate the libSBML language interfaces.  Please see the section
below on using <a href="#SWIG">SWIG</a>.

<p> Finally, note that these additional language bindings are
implemented via foreign function interfaces in the respective
languages; in all cases, the basic C/C++ libSBML library still must be
compiled and installed.  The language binding files are not standalone
implementations.  For instance, the Java language API files consist of
a file named <code>libsbmlj.jar</code> and a native object library
file named <code>libsbmlj.jnilib</code>; <em>both</em> of these must
be installed and shipped with applications <em>along with</em> the
basic libSBML library file.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="compiling">Compiling and installing libSBML on
Unix, Linux and MacOS X</a></h3>

<p>
Once configured, building should be very easy.  Simply execute the
following commands at your Linux, MacOS&nbsp;X or Solaris command prompt:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make
  make install
</pre></div>

<p> Note that you will probably have to perform the make install
command as the user 'root' on your system if you used the default
installation directory ( <code>/usr/local</code>) or you set <code>
--prefix</code> to a system directory that only root is permitted to
write into.

<p> Depending on your operating system, the basic libSBML object
library file installed by the commands above will be a file named
<code>libsbml.so</code>, <code>libsbml.dll</code>, or
<code>libsbml.dylib</code>, and on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux,
MacOS&nbsp;X), a static library file as well (<code>libsbml.a</code>).
If you have compiled additional language extensions with libSBML,
these files will also be installed in the same directory.  For
example, as discussed above, the Java language API files consist of a
file named <code>libsbmlj.jar</code> and a native object library file
named <code>libsbmlj.jnilib</code>; these will be installed in the
same directory as the core libSBML library file.

<p> If all went as it should, libSBML should end up compiled and
installed on your system, in either the default location
(<code>/usr/local/</code>) or in the location you indicated during the
configuration step as explained above.



<h3><a class="anchor" name="accessing">Making libSBML accessible to other
software on Unix, Linux and MacOS&nbsp;X systems</a></h3>

<p> Once the libSBML files are installed as described in the previous
section, you will need to do one more configuration step to make it
accessible from other software at <i>run</i> time: you and your users'
software environments may need to be configured to <i>find</i> the
libSBML library files.  On most platforms, this must be done either by
running the system program <code>ldconfig</code> as user 'root'
(consult the man page for ldconfig if this is unfamiliar), or else
each user must set the environment variable
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in their command shells.  (On
MacOS&nbsp;X, the variable is named <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
Also, there is no equivalent on MacOS&nbsp;X to the
<code>ldconfig</code> facility.)  The path added to the
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
variable must be the directory used as the value of the
<code>--prefix=</code><em>DIR</em> option used during the
<code>configure</code> step <a href="#basic-config">discussed
above</a>.

<p> If your run-time environment and the run-time environment for your
software applications do not know to look in the installation
directory for libSBML, programs that require libSBML will fail to run
with errors about being unable to find it.



<h3><a class="anchor" name="other-options">Additional options for configuring LibSBML</a></h3>

<p> In addition to the <code>--prefix</code> and other options already
described, the libSBML configuration command supports the options
described below.



<h4><a class="anchor" name="swig">Configuring SWIG</a></h4>

<p> <strong>Important</strong>: At this time, libSBML is known to work
<em>only</em> with the latest stable version of SWIG (1.3.31); earlier
versions are known not to work.

<p> SWIG is the <em>Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator</em>
and in libSBML it is used to create the bindings for Java, Python, and
other programming languages.  More information about SWIG is available
from <a href="http://www.swig.org">http://www.swig.org</a>.  To
configure libSBML to use SWIG, use the <code>--with-swig</code> option
to <code>configure</code>.  If your copy of SWIG is installed in a
location where <code>configure</code> cannot find it on its own, you
can specify it as an optional argument to the <code>--with-swig</code>
option as in the following example:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-swig="DIR"
</pre></div>

<p> As with Expat and Xerces, the directory <code>/sw</code> is what
you would specify if you were running on MacOS&nbsp;X and you used <a
href="http://finkproject.org">Fink</a> to install SWIG, Python, etc.


<h4><a class="anchor" name="unit-testing">Configuring unit testing</a></h4>

<p> libSBML provides built-in facilities for testing itself.  To run
the unit tests, a second library is required, <code>libcheck</code>
(version 0.9.2 or higher).  Check is a very lightweight C unit test
framework based on the xUnit framework popularized by Kent Beck and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">eXtreme
Programming</a>.  Check is quite small and once installed, it consists
of only two files: <code>libcheck.a</code> and <code>check.h</code>.
To download Check, visit <a
href="http://check.sf.net/">http://check.sf.net/</a>.

<p> (Note: Debian users can find Check as a standard add-on package
(<code>.deb</code>).  As of 11 Feb. 2007, MacOS&nbsp;X users
<em>cannot</em> use <a href="http://finkproject.org">Fink</a>'s
version of check because it is an old version, 0.8.x.  LibSBML needs
version 0.9.x.)

<p> To enable the unit testing facilities in libSBML, add the
<code>--with-check</code> flag to the configure command:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-check
</pre></div>

<p>
Following this, you must build libSBML and then you can run the tests:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make
  make check
</pre></div>

<p> The make check step is optional and will build and run an
extensive suite of unit tests to verify all facets of the library.
These tests are meant primarily for developers of libSBML and running
them is not required for the library to function properly.  All tests
should pass with no failures or errors.  If for some reason this is
not the case on your system, please submit a bug report using the
mechanisms described in the section titled "Bug Reports, Mailing
Lists, and Related Topics" elsewhere in this manual.


<h4><a class="anchor" name="docs">Configuring for generating documentation</a></h4>

<p> LibSBML comes with extensive documentation, and the document you
are currently reading is part of it.  Because the documentation is
large and regenerating it requires the use of software tools that not
all users may have, the authors of libSBML supply a separate
downloadable archive containing only the documentation.  The
documentation archive file has a name of the form
<code>libsbml-<em>VERSION</em>-docs.zip</code>, where
<code><em>VERSION</em></code> is the version of libSBML.  After you
download it, you can simply unzip the file in the same location as
your libSBML source directory (or alternatively, in any other location
that suits you).  We recommend downloading the ready-made
documentation archive as the easiest way to get the libSBML
documentation.

<p> The same documentation files should also be available online at <a
href="http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/">http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/</a>,
although this online copy normally corresponds to the last stable
release of libSBML and may not be up-to-date with the latest version
of libSBML in CVS.

<p> If you wish to generate the documentation yourself, you will need
the following software tools in addition to a Unix-like environment
(or Cygwin under Windows):
<ul>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em>For the C, C++ and Python API
documentation</em>: You will need <a
href="http://doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> version 1.4.9 and a reasonably
complete installation of <a
href="http://ctan.org/what_is_tex.html">LaTeX</a>.  You will also need
to configure libSBML to use Doxygen by supplying the option
<code>--with-doxygen</code> to the <code>configure</code> program.
<em>Warning</em>: this option is unlike the other configuration
options, in that if the optional pathname argument is supplied, the
pathname must be the <em>path to the Doxygen executable</em> itself,
not the path to the directory where Doxygen is located.  In other
words, in using the optional argument, you should end up with
something such as the following,

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-doxygen=/sw/bin/doxygen 
</pre></div>

rather than (for example) <tt>--with-doxygen=/sw/bin</tt>.  If you are
on a MacOS&nbsp;X system and you installed the binary Mac distribution
of Doxygen (in the form of a <code>.dmg</code> image), you will have
to point <code>configure</code> to the doxygen executable inside the
package for Doxygen:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  ./configure --with-doxygen=/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen
</pre></div>
</li>

</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em>For the Java API
documentation</em>: You will need <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a> version 1.5 (also
known as version 5.0, confusingly enough), which should have come
supplied with your installation of Java 1.5 or later.  No additional
configuration of libSBML is needed beyond supplying the
<code>--with-java</code> option to <code>configure</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Once libSBML is configured as above, you can generate the
documentation files by running <code>make docs</code> from the top
level of the libSBML source directory to regenerate all the
documentation files.  Alternatively, you can moving to the
<code>docs/src</code> subdirectory and execute

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make java-manual
</pre></div>
to recreate just the Java documentation, or 
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make cpp-manual
</pre></div>
to recreate just the C++ documentation, or 
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make c-manual
</pre></div>
to recreate just the C documentation, or
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make python-manual
</pre></div>
to recreate just the Python documentation.



<h3><a class="anchor" name="windows">Configuring and building for Windows</a></h3>

<p> The Windows distributions of libSBML come in the form of both
precompiled binaries (with a self-extracting installer), and source
code.  The precompiled binaries come ready-to-use and only need to be
installed.  The source distribution is a <code>.zip</code> file
containing the libSBML code that must be extracted in a directory on
your system, compiled and installed.

<p> As mentioned above, libSBML requires that the Xerces-C, Expat or
libxml XML parsing libraries be available on your computer prior to
attempting to compile libSBML.  The DLL for Xerces, Expat or libxml
must be placed in the <code>win32/bin</code> subdirectory of the
libSBML directory.

To build libsbml on Windows:
<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
 In Visual Studio 7, open <code>&lt;libsbml&gt;/win32/MSVC7/libsbml.sln</code>.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
 Select Tools->Options, and select Projects/Directories.
   The screen for indicating which directories contain project-relevant
   files appears.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
 At "Show Directories For:", select "Include Files".  Add the
   following if it's not already shown: <code><em>libsbml</em>/include</code>
 <p>Note: you will also need to add the path to the include files 
 relevant to the XML Parser library.</p>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
 At "Show Directories For:", select "Library Files".  Add the
   following if it's not already shown: <code><em>libsbml</em>/win32/bin</code>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
 Select Build->Rebuild All from the Visual Studio main menu.
</li>
</ol>
