<p>
LibSBML is an application programming interface (API) library for reading,
writing and manipulating files and data streams containing SBML content.
Developers can embed the library in their applications, saving themselves
the work of implementing their own parsing, manipulation and validation
software.  At the API level, the library provides the same interface to
data structures independently of whether the model originated in SBML
Level&nbsp;1 or 2.  The library currently also offers the ability to
translate SBML Level&nbsp;1 models to SBML Level&nbsp;2 and (to some
extent) from Level&nbsp;2 to Level&nbsp;1 as well.

<p>
LibSBML is written in ISO standard C++ and C and is highly portable.  It is
currently supported on the Linux, Solaris, MacOS&nbsp;X, and Microsoft
Windows operating systems.  The library provides language bindings for C,
C++, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Common Lisp, with support for other
languages planned for the future.  The package is distributed in both
source-code form and as precompiled dynamic libraries for the Microsoft
Windows, Linux and Apple MacOS&nbsp;X operating systems; they are available
from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml"><code>sbml</code>
project on SourceForge.net</a>.


<h2>Advantages of a dedicated library for SBML</h2>

Why not simply use a generic XML parsing library?  After all, SBML is
usually expressed in XML, and there exist plenty of XML parsers, so why not
simply tell people to use one of them, rather than develop a specialized
library?  The answer is: while it is true that developers <em>can</em> use
general-purpose XML libraries, there are many reasons why using a system
such as libSBML is a vastly better choice.

<p>
One of the features of libSBML is its facilities for manipulating
mathematical formulas supporting differences in representation between SBML
Level&nbsp;1 and SBML Level&nbsp;2.  LibSBML provides an API that allows
working with formulas in both text-string and MathML form, and to
interconvert mathematical expressions between these forms.  The utility of
this facility extends beyond converting between SBML Level&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2.  Many software packages provide users with the ability to
express formulas for such things as reaction rate expressions, and these
packages' interfaces often let users type in the formulas directly as text
strings.  LibSBML saves application programmers the work of developing
formula manipulation and translation functionality.  It makes it possible
to translate those formula strings directly into Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs), manipulate them using AST operations, and write them out in the
MathML format of SBML Level&nbsp;2.

<p>
Another feature of libSBML is the validation it performs on SBML inputs at
the time of parsing files and data streams.  This helps verify the
correctness of models in a way that goes beyond simple syntactic
validation.  Still another invaluable feature of libSBML is the
domain-specific operations it provides beyond simple SBML-specific accessor
facilities.  Examples of such operations include obtaining a count of the
number of boundary condition species, determining the modifier species of a
reaction (assuming the reaction provides kinetics), and constructing the
stoichiometric matrix for all reactions in a model.

<p>
Some of the other features of libSBML include the following:
<ul>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em"> <em>Parser abstraction layer</em>.
  LibSBML relies on third-party XML parser libraries, but thanks to its
  implementation of an abstraction layer, libSBML can use any of three
  different popular XML parser libraries: Expat, Apache Xerces-C++, and
  Libxml2.  LibSBML provides identical functionality and checking of XML
  syntax is now available no matter which one is used.  SBML Documents are
  parsed and manipulated in the Unicode codepage for efficiency (this is
  Xerces-C++ native format); however, strings are transcoded to the local
  code page for SBML structures.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Small memory footprint and fast runtime</em>.
  The parser is event-based (SAX2) and loads SBML data into C++ structures
  that mirror the SBML specification.  As an example of libSBML's
  performance, a sample file generated by <a
  href="http://www.gepasi.org">Gepasi</a> known as the <em>100 Yeast
  file</em> (2&nbsp;MB in size, 2000 reactions; see
  http://www.gepasi.org/gep3sbml.html) loads in 1.18&nbsp;s on a 1&nbsp;GHz
  AMD Athlon XP and uses only 1.4&nbsp;MB of memory.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Full SBML Support</em>.
  All constructs in SBML Level 1 (Versions 1 and 2) and SBML Level 2 are
  supported, with the exception of three rarely-used MathML constructs
  (specifically, <tt>&lt;semantics&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;annotation&gt;</tt>
  and <tt>&lt;annotation-xml&gt;</tt>).  These exceptions will be removed
  in the near future.  LibSBML handles such SBML differences as the
  alternate spellings of @e species and @e annotation between the SBML
  specifications.  For compatibility with some technically incorrect but
  popular Level&nbsp;1 documents, the parser recognizes and stores notes
  and annotations defined for the top-level <tt>&lt;sbml&gt;</tt> element
  (logging a warning).</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Dimensional analysis and unit
  checking</em>.  LibSBML implements a thorough system for dimensional
  analysis and checking units of quantities in a model.  The validation
  rules for units that are specified in SBML Level 2 Version&nbsp;2 and
  Version&nbsp;3 are fully implemented, including checking units in
  mathematical formulas.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Unified SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
  Level&nbsp;1 object models</em>.  All objects have
  <code>.getSBMLDocument()</code>, <code>.getModel()</code>,
  <code>.getLevel()</code>, and <code>.getVersion()</code>, among other
  things.  Also, the interface to SBML's <em>Rules</em> abstracts away some
  of the individual rule type (assignment, rate, algebraic)
  differences.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Access to SBML annotations and notes
  as XML objects</em>.  Annotations and notes are read and manipulated as
  XML structures instead of text strings.  Further, in order to facilitate
  the support of <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam">MIRIAM</a>
  compatible annotations, there are new object classes ModelHistory and
  CVTerm.  These classes facilitate the creation and addition of RDF
  annotations inside <tt>&lt;annotation&gt;</tt> elements by providing
  parsing and manipulation functions that treat the annotations in terms of
  XMLNode objects implemented by the new XML layer.  Both ModelHistory and
  CVTerm follow the general libSBML format of providing getters and setters
  for each variable stored within the class.</li>
      
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Interfaces for C, C++, Java, Python, Perl
  and MATLAB</em>.  C and C++ interfaces are implemented natively; the Java,
  Perl, and Python interfaces are implemented using <a
  href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>, the Simplified Wrapper Interface
  Generator.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Well tested: version 3.0.0 has over
  1280 unit tests and 5800 individual assertions</em>.  The entire library
  was written using the test-first approach popularized by Kent Beck and
  eXtreme Programming, where it's one of the 12 principles.</li>
    
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Written in portable, pure ISO C and
  C++</em>. The build system uses GNU tools (Autoconf, GNU Make) to build
  shared and static libraries.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Full XML and SBML Validation</em>.
  All XML and Schema warning, error and fatal error messages are logged
  with line and column number information and may be retrieved and
  manipulated programmatically.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">  <em>Complete user
  manual</em>. Documentation is available in the "docs" subdirectory in
  both pre-formatted and source form.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Manipulating mathematical formulas</h2>

<p>
In SBML Level&nbsp;1, mathematical formulas are represented as text
strings using a C-like syntax.  This representation was chosen because of
its simplicity, widespread familiarity and use in applications such as
Gepasi and Jarnac, whose authors contributed to the initial design of
SBML.  For SBML Level&nbsp;2, there was a need to expand the mathematical
vocabulary of Level&nbsp;1 to include additional functions (both built-in
and user-defined), mathematical constants, logical operators, relational
operators and a special symbol to represent time.  Rather than growing the
simple C-like syntax into something more complicated and esoteric in order
to support these features, and consequently having to manage two standards
in two different formats (XML and text string formulas), SBML Level 2
leverages an existing standard for expressing mathematical formulas, namely
the content portion of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>.

<p>
LibSBML provides an abstraction for working with mathematical expressions
in both text-string and MathML form: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax
Trees</a> are well-known in the computer science community; they are simple
recursive data structures useful for representing the syntactic structure
of sentences in certain kinds of languages (mathematical or otherwise).
Much as libSBML allows programmers to manipulate SBML at the level of
domain-specific objects, regardless of SBML level or version, it also
allows programmers to work with mathematical formula at the level of ASTs
regardless of whether the original format was C-like infix or MathML.
LibSBML goes one step further by allowing programmers to work exclusively
with infix formula strings and instantly convert them to the appropriate
MathML whenever needed.
