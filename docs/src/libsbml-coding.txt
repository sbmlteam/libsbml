@section coding-intro 1. Introduction

This document is a collection of guidelines for libSBML authors to follow
when writing documentation for libSBML code.

LibSBML's application programming interface (API) is documented using a
combination of tools.  For almost all languages (C++, C#, C, Python, and
others), the cornerstone of the approach is the open-source software tool <a
href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>; for Java, we use Javadoc instead.
We write the documentation in source code and auxiliary files in a way that
both Javadoc and Doxygen can process more or less equally, which requires
that programmers and documentation authors follow various conventions
described in the rest of this document.  In addition, we use various
home-grown scripts and programs to massage the output of SWIG to produce
something that can be fed to the Doxygen and Javadoc-based processs.  


@section coding-basic 2. Basic guidelines for writing libSBML documentation

The guidelines presented in this section are oriented towards explaining how
to organize code comments such that Doxygen and Javadoc can produce good
output, yet simultaneously make the comments in the libSBML code files be
readable on their own.

@li Although Doxygen keywords/tags can be prefixed with either @c \@ or @c
@\\, Javadoc only understands keywords prefixed with @c \@.  Consequently,
always use the @c \@ prefix for keywords so that they will be understood by
both Doxygen and Javadoc.
@li The main types of Doxygen comments consist of a C-style comment block
beginning with two asterisks (@c *) characters, as in the following example:
@verbatim
/**
 * Comments that start with two asterisks within which commands understood by
 * Doxygen will begin with the character @.
 */ 
@endverbatim
Another type of Doxygen comment, used to document enumeration members, begins
with <code>/*!&lt;</code>.  If your code documentation does @em not appear
inside a comment block that begins with <code>/**</code> (or the more
rarely-needed <code>/*!&lt;</code>), then it will be ignored by
Doxygen.  This may or may not be what you want, depending on the intention
behind the comment.
@li Comments that begin with one asterisk (i.e., <code>/* ...</code>, or two
forward slashes (i.e., <code>// ...</code>) are not processed by Doxygen and
not entered in the formatted user guide.  You can use such comments normally
to comment the code for other developers.
@li Doxygen comment blocks can appear at the beginning of a file, in front of
a class declaration, in front of method declarations, in front of function
declarations, and in front of data structure definitions.
@li Doxygen reads both <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files.  If a
class member (i.e., a method or data member) has <code>/**</code> comment
blocks in both the <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files, the text is
@em combined in the final output for that class member.  This frequently
leads to accidentally duplicated text in the final output, and generally is a
maintenance headache.  To avoid this, and to simplify maintenance of
documentation, <strong>only put documentation comments in the <code>.h</code>
files</strong>.
@li Please write in complete sentences, with correct English grammar and
punctuation.  @em Do @em not treat new lines as new sentences or beginnings
of different comments.  Here is an example of what should be @em avoided:
@verbatim
/**
 * creates a foo object
 * given arg is the template
 */
@endverbatim
The text above doesn't end sentences with periods, doesn't begin sentences
with capitals, doesn't form complete sentences, etc.  When Doxygen is used
to generate HTML documentation from this, it turns into one long run-on
paragraph, and it's unreadable.
@li We use a feature of Doxygen that makes it use the first sentence
of a documentation comment as the "brief" description of the entity being
described (which may be a class, a method, a class data member, a function,
a typedef, etc.).  This means that the first sentence up to a period or a
blank line will be pulled out separately and used as a one-line summary in
certain contexts by Doxygen.  The following is an example:
@verbatim
/**
 * This is the brief description.  After the first sentence, even if
 * you continue writing in the same paragraph, the output nevertheless
 * is split after the first sentence such that everything else is part of
 * the detailed description and not the brief one-sentence description.
 * This example would produce two paragraphs in the formatted output:
 * one paragraph containing the first sentence, and the rest of the
 * text in the second paragraph.
 *
 * If you also have a third paragraph separated by a blank line in the
 * comment, like this, then this third paragraph becomes a third paragraph
 * in the output.  This part is what most people would expect would happen.
 */
@endverbatim
Consequently, to emphasize this and remind people that this is going to
happen when the API documentation is generated, it is better to format the
comment such that there is a paragraph break after the first sentence,
as follows:
@verbatim
/**
 * This is the brief description.
 *
 * This is the beginning of the detailed description....
 */
@endverbatim
The visual split in the source makes it more obvious what's going to happen.
@li Doxygen automatically turns entity names it recognizes in text into links
to the definition of that entity.  This is usually what you want to have
happen; for example, when describing the Model class, you may mention classes
such as Species and Compartment, and those should be turned into convenient
links to their definitions in the API documentation.  However, sometimes you
<em>don't</em> want that to happen.  To prevent Doxygen from linking a word,
put a percentage sign (\%) in front of it, as in @c \%%Model.  Doxygen will
remove the percentage sign and leave the rest of the word unlinked, resulting
in the plain word %Model appearing in the finished document.
@li Sometimes methods are meant to be part of the internal implementation and
not advertised to users of the library.  To make Doxygen ignore methods,
wrap their declarations in the <code>.h</code> files with the comment
@verbatim
/** @cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal */
@endverbatim
at the beginning and 
@verbatim
/** @endcond */
@endverbatim
at the end of the block.  This is merely a convention used in libSBML and not
something that Doxygen defines; we simply use the normal Doxygen conditional
test operator <code>@@cond</code> and give it a symbol we never define:
"doxygenLibsbmlInternal".  The symbol name is chosen to suggest the
purpose.  Note: if there are multiple methods to be marked in this way,
<strong>wrap them individually</strong>, placing the <code>@@cond</code>
and <code>@@endcond</code> pairs immediately before and after each method.
This makes it much more likely that a reader will notice what is happening in
the source files.  The alternative approach (putting single
<code>@@cond</code> and <code>@@endcond</code> pairs around a group of
methods) makes it much harder to determine which methods are marked as
internal in a file.
@li If an entire file should be omitted from the user documentation, use the
same <code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> method but put the conditional
near the top of the file and the <code>@@endcond</code> at the very end of the
file.  In other words, the top of your file should look like this example:
@verbatim
/**
 * @cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal
 *
 * @file    ExpatAttributes.cpp
 * @brief   Creates new XMLAttributes from "raw" Expat attributes.
 * ...
@endverbatim

@li Always put a @c @@class declaration in every file for every class, even
if they are marked as internal using the
<code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> method described above.  Due to
the way our documentation toolchain works, in order for Doxygen and Javadoc
to see the markers we insert to indicate internal classes and methods, it is
necessary for classes to have an @c @@class declaration <em>even if</em> a 
file has the <code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> guards around it.  
In other words, the file still needs to have the @c @@class definition for
things to work.  The easiest convention to adopt is simply to always put the
@c @@class and @c @@sbmlbrief pairs in every class, no matter what.  If the
file is for internal code, then also put the
<code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> around the entire contents inside.
The use of @c @@sbmlbrief and @c @@class is discussed further in Section @ref
coding-doc-h below.
@li Do <strong>not</strong> use <code>@@retval</code> for describing return
values; instead, use <code>@@return</code> because (1) it is what Javadoc uses
and (2) the narrative form of <code>@@return</code> lets you provide more
contextual information and other details in describing the return value(s) of
a method or function.
@li Please try to limit the lengths of lines in all files to 79 characters
long or less. This makes code and documentation generally easier to read and
edit in different software tools.  Sometimes it's too difficult to avoid a
long line, and then it's okay, but generally it's possible to reformat code
in such away as to keep things to 79 characters.
@li Please write sentences with @em two (2) spaces after the terminating
period, not one.  This makes the resulting text easier to read during
editing, compared to when sentence-ending periods are followed by only one
space.  (Note that this concerns the readability and editability of source
code, not the appearance of rendered output.  The finished typeset output will
@em not have two spaces after every sentence-ending period; it will have one
or slightly more than one, depending on the output format produced.  The
reason two-spacing is important for the source is that most people use
monospaced fonts in their text editors and IDEs, and when using monospaced
fonts, the ends of sentences are much easier for human eyes to pick out when
two-spacing is used.  Further, text editing programs such as Emacs and vi
have special features to recognize sentences based on this pattern, and
proficient users of those editors can make use of sentence-oriented editing
commands.  This is a convention that some people disagree with.  Please use
this convention for libSBML anyway.)


@section coding-docs 3. Guidelines for different file types

Below are explanations of how to write documentation for the most common
types of files encountered in libSBML.


@subsection coding-doc-h 3.1 Guidelines for .h files

It is important to note that the documentation of global functions,
variables, typedefs, and enums will only be included in the output of
Doxygen if the file they are in is also documented.

@li Here is a template header file suitable for use when creating a new
<code>.h</code> file for libSBML (and in fact, it's the same for
<code>.cpp</code> files, too).  Of course, you should substitute appropriate
content for the text in square brackets (@c [ and @c ]) below:
@verbatim
/**
 * @file    [filename]
 * @brief   [succinct description of what's in this file]
 * @author  [author's name]
 * 
 *<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file is part of libSBML.  Please visit http://sbml.org for more
 * information about SBML, and the latest version of libSBML.

 *----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->*/
@endverbatim
@li When more than one author should be acknowledged for a given file, use 
multiple <code>@@author</code> entries, one per line.
@li A <code>.h</code> file will typically have a class declaration in it.
The @em normal, plain Doxygen way that one would document a class (but we do
not do it this way) is to put a comment block immediately in front of the
class declaration in the file.  However, we have to do it differently because
of how our files are used to generate output for multiple language bindings.
Thus, for the documentation of classes, <strong>please put the documentation
in the file header rather that ahead of the class itself</strong> in the
file.  The following example illustrates this procedure (and note how more
than one class can be described in the header):
@verbatim
/**
 * @file    Compartment.h
 * [...]
 *
 * @class Compartment
 * @sbmlbrief{core} Implementation of SBML's %Compartment construct.
 *
 * A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
 * located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
 * ....
 *
 * <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 * @class ListOfCompartments
 * @sbmlbrief{core} Implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's %ListOfCompartments
 * construct.
 * 
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
 * ....
 */

#ifndef Compartment_h
#define Compartment_h
...
@endverbatim
@li Use the special keyword <code>@@sbmlbrief</code> to indicate the SBML
Level&nbsp;3 package to which a class belongs.  This keyword takes one
argument, a label for the package; for SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core code, use the
label "core".  Place the keyword immediately on the line after each
<code>@@class</code> declaration in the <code>.h</code> file, and then write
a brief one-sentence description of the class after the keyword.  The example
file fragment above demonstrates this.  (As you might guess from its name,
the keyword <code>@@sbmlbrief</code> is something defined by libSBML's
documentation-production system and not a standard Doxygen command.)
@li For each method or data member in the class definition, include a
comment block ahead of it, making sure to provide at least a brief
description.  If it takes parameters, use @c @@param to describe the
parameters.  If it's a method and the method returns a value, also use @c
@@return to describe the returned value.  If you also need to refer to the
parameters in the textual description of the method, use the @c @@p command.
The following example illustrates this:
@verbatim
/**
 * Creates a new CompartmentType, optionally with the given @p id and
 * @p name attribute values.
 *
 * In SBML, identifiers are required for CompartmentType objects;
 * however, the identifier does not have to be set at the time of
 * creation of the object, and instead can be set using the setId()
 * method on the SBase parent class.
 *
 * @param id a string, the identifier of this CompartmentType instance
 * @param name a string, the optional name of this
 */
CompartmentType (const std::string& id = "", const std::string& name = "");
@endverbatim
@li Please try to leave 2 blank lines between method declarations and other
items in the definitions of classes.  This makes it easier for the eye to
spot transitions between method definitions. Here is an example taken
from a class definition in a <code>.h</code> file:
@verbatim
class LIBSBML_EXTERN CompartmentType : public SBase
{
public:

  /**
   * Creates a new CompartmentType, optionally with the given @p id and @p
   * name attribute values.
   *
   * In SBML, identifiers are required for CompartmentType objects;
   * however, the identifier does not have to be set at the time of
   * creation of the object, and instead can be set using the setId()
   * method on the SBase parent class.
   *
   * @param id a string, the identifier of this CompartmentType instance
   * @param name a string, the optional name of this
   */
  CompartmentType (const std::string& id = "", const std::string& name = "");


  /**
   * Destroys this CompartmentType.
   */
  virtual ~CompartmentType ();


  /**
   * Copy constructor; creates a copy of this CompartmentType.
   */
  CompartmentType(const CompartmentType& orig);
@endverbatim


@subsection coding-doc-cpp 3.2 Guidelines for .cpp files

The <code>.cpp</code> files can be handled very similarly to the
<code>.h</code> files described above.  You may use the same header template
shown in the previous section about <code>.h</code> files, and all the same
guidelines apply.

As noted above, when the API manual is generated by Doxygen, it will use the
comments from the <code>.h</code> file as the source of the documentation for
the class and methods.  It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the class or
other descriptions placed in the <code>.h</code> file.  However, do provide
normal comments (using either the single-asterisk form or the double-slash
form of C++ comments) about the code so that in the future, you and others
would read the file can better understand what the code is doing.


@section coding-other-situations 4. How to handle important common situations

The descriptions above cover the basics of using Doxygen and Javadoc for
libSBML documentation.  What follows is a discussion of other, more involved
topics.

@subsection coding-reusing-text 4.1 Reusing common text

One often encounters the need to repeat the same text in different places in
the documentation, such as to add a detail to each method where the detail
may be relevant.  In software documentation, unlike in non-technical prose or
creative writing, it is actually @em better to repeat text&mdash;or refer to
a common section&mdash;everywhere that it might be relevant, because a reader
does not normally read class and method documentation linearly: they jump to
a method description from elsewhere.  This means that the descriptions need
to be reasonably self-contained.  However, copy-pasting text leads to an
obvious maintenance nightmare, requiring any updates or changes to be made in
multiple places.  We avoid this in libSBML by writing common text as reusable
blocks, then using a two types of text inclusion mechanisms to insert the
common text where it is needed.

@subsubsection coding-copydetails 4.1.1 Using "copydetails"

One approach we use to copy common text blocks in libSBML is to use the
Doxygen <code>@@copydetails</code> command, but we do so using specific
conventions.  Experienced Doxygen users may be initially confused by our use
of this command, because strictly speaking, we are not using it exactly as
intended.  This Doxygen command is actually intended for copying the
"non-brief" part of the documentation of an object, such as a class, for use
in documenting multiple similar objects.  Unfortunately, Doxygen does not
offer any other means of copying text fragments except for
<code>@@htmlinclude</code> (discussed below), and the alternative versions of
the <code>@@copydetails</code> command (i.e., <code>@@copybrief</code> and
<code>@@copydoc</code>) have undesirable properties in the output they
produce.  Consequently, we have resorted to using <code>@@copydetails</code>
in combination with some conventions to achieve what we need.

@li To define a block of text to be reused, use the <code>@@class</code>
command and give the class a name that begins with the prefix
<code>doc_</code>.  Separate the class declaration with a blank line.  Here
is an example:
@verbatim
 * @class doc_what_is_listof
 *
 * @par
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
@endverbatim
We configure Doxygen to ignore symbols that begin with the string
<code>doc_</code>, so these class definitions will never really be defined in
the formatted output&mdash;they are fake class declarations used simply so
that we can employ <code>@@copydetails</code> elsewhere.
@li Note the use of <code>@@par</code> in the example above. This is a hack
to force Doxygen to treat the rest of the text as the "detail" portion of a
class documentation.  <strong>Make sure to put <code>@@par</code> on a line
by itself</strong>, or it will not work properly.  Special cases: if your text
block begins with <code>@@note</code> or <code>@@warning</code> or similar,
you do not need to put the <code>@@par</code> first.
@li For readability in the source code file, if you have more than one
<code>@@class doc_...</code> definition, separate them with an HTML comment
consisting of a line of dashes. Example:
@verbatim
 * @class doc_what_are_sbmlnamespaces
 *
 * @par 
 * The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
 * information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and (in
 * Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.  A
 * common approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
 * SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that object
 * as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as arguments.
 *
 * <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 * @class doc_what_is_SBMLDocument
 *
 * @par
 * LibSBML uses the class SBMLDocument as a top-level container for
@endverbatim
@li To use the text, that is, to insert a text block somewhere in the body of
a documentation string, use the command <code>@@copydetails</code> followed
by the name of the (fake) documentation class.  Here is an example:
@htmlinclude libsbml-coding-copydetails-example.html

Finally where should you put these <code>@@class</code> definitions for
creating reusable text blocks?  Use one of the following two locations:

-# An individual file where references to the block are made, when the text
is specific to that file and never used outside of it; or
-# The file <code>src/sbml/common/common-documentation.h</code>, when the
text is something to be reused in multiple other files.

The use of <code>@@copydetails</code> has the advantage that all of the
normal Doxygen processing will be done within the text block.  Importantly,
this includes the automatic linking of cross-reference to classes, methods,
and other objects.  In general, the use of <code>@@copydetails</code> is
preferable to the use of <code>@@htmlinclude</code> described below, but in
some situations you ned to resort to the latter command.


@subsubsection coding-htmlinclude 4.1.2 Using "htmlinclude"

The <code>@@copydetails</code> method described above works well for most
situations, except when you need to use significant HTML commands for special
formatting.  Some HTML commands will either be intercepted by Doxygen, or
else it may become very awkward to write the HTML as comments in a
<code>.h</code> file.  In those cases, using Doxygen's
<code>@@htmlinclude</code> can be a better option.

The <code>@@htmlinclude</code> command takes a single argument, the name of a
file.  This file must be placed in a preconfigured location; we use the
directory <code>docs/src/common-text/</code> to store files for use with this
command.  Here is an example of the use of <code>@@htmlinclude</code>:
@verbatim
 * The list of possible types is quite long, because it covers all the
 * mathematical functions that are permitted in SBML. The values are shown
 * in the following table:
 *
 * @htmlinclude astnode-types.html
@endverbatim
The file will be included in-line at the location where the reference is made
in a documentation string.

It is worth reiterating that normal Doxygen processing is not performed
inside the contents of the file included through this mechanism.
Cross-references will not be made, the Doxygen <code>@@</code>&nbsp;commands will
be ignored, etc.  For most cases, it is preferable to use the
<code>@@copydetails</code> approach described in the previous section.


@subsection coding-links 4.2 Links

Most of the time, you can rely on Doxygen's ability to connect a written
reference to a class or method to the definition of that class or method.  In
a few cases, however, you must write an explicit <code>@@link</code>
... <code>@@endlink</code> command.  The syntax of this Doxygen command
consists of the target of the link, optionally followed by a name to be used
for the link.

In libSBML, the most common situation where an explicit link is needed is in
references to enumeration values such as method/function return codes.  In
those cases, to create a link, use the name of the enumeration (e.g.,
<code>OperationReturnValues_t</code>), followed by a pound sign (@c #),
followed by the enumeration member, optionally followed by a space and then a
name for the link.  If the optional space and name are omitted, the name of
the link is made the same as the full name of the target; this is generally
@em not desirable because the result is more difficult to read.

Here is an example, drawn from the documentation of the return type of a
method on the Compartment class.  In these cases, the name of the link is
given as simply the name of the enumeration member without the enumeration
prefix:
@htmlinclude libsbml-coding-link-example.html

Another situation that calls for explicit links involves the non-C++
languages.  There, it is common to need to refer to a constant defined on the
class or package <code>libsbml</code>.  Here is an example:
@verbatim
* @if python LibSBML attaches an identifying
* code to every kind of SBML object.  These are known as <em>SBML type
* codes</em>.  In the Python language interface for libSBML, the type
* codes are defined as static integer constants in the interface class
* @link libsbml@endlink.  @endif
@endverbatim


@subsection coding-conditionals 4.3 Conditional text

Speaking of non-C++ languages, it very often happens that one needs to adapt
the documentation for something based on the programming language.  We have
configured Doxygen to define different symbols depending on the language for
which the output is being generated; these symbols can be used with Doxygen's
<code>@@if</code> command to introduce text conditionally.  The following
table lists the symbols defined for different languages:

<table border="0" class="centered text-table width80 normal-font alt-row-colors">
 <tr>
     <th align="left">Language</th>
     <th align="left">Symbols defined</th>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td>C</td>
  <td><code>conly</code>, <code>clike</code>, <code>notcpp</code>, <code>doxygenCOnly</code>, <code>doxygenCLikeOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C++</td>
  <td><code>cpp</code>, <code>clike</code>, <code>doxygenCppOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C#</td>
  <td><code>csharp</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>notcpp</code>, <code>doxygenCsharpOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Java</td>
  <td><code>java</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>notcpp</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Perl</td>
  <td><code>perl</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>notcpp</code>, <code>doxygenPerlOnly</code> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Python</td>
  <td><code>python</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>notcpp</code>, <code>doxygenPythonOnly</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

<strong>Important:</strong> Doxygen removes the white space surrounding the
text inside the conditional and after the @c @@endif.  This is highly
problematic in most situations, because it produces run-together text in the
output.  We believe this is a bug and have reported it to the Doxygen
developers, but as of version 1.8.6, the behavior persists.  To avoid the
problem, use the following hack: unless the next character after @c @@endif
is a punctuation character or it is the end of the text block, put the
sequence <code>@@~</code> after the @c @@endif.  In other words, write
<code>@@endif@@~</code> in the input, rather than a bare @c @@endif.


@subsection coding-common-text 4.4 Notes and warnings

We use two Doxygen commands to produce text that is highlighted in the output
in certain ways, to call attention to special issues.  These commands do not
take any arguments and should be placed before the paragraph of the text to
be highlighted.  

To call out something special about a class, function, file or other entity,
such as a behavior that should be brought to the attention of users or a note
about API changes, please use the @c @@note command.  This formats the next
paragraph with the heading "Note:".

To make a stronger statement, for example to warn users about potentially
error-provoking situations or backward-incompatible changes in the API, use
the @c @@warning command.  This formats the following paragraph with the
heading "Warning:".  <strong>Important</strong>: due to limitations in our
documentation pipeline (in particular, in the use of Javadoc), the desired
formatting can currently only be achieved through the use of an additional
explicit bit of HTML code.  Specifically, please wrap the paragraph with an
HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element that puts the paragraph contents
inside the CSS class "warning".  The following example fragment illustrates
this:
@verbatim
 * @class doc_warning_typecodes_not_unique
 *
 * @warning <span class="warning">The specific integer values of 
 * the possible type codes may be reused by different Level 3
 * package plug-ins.</span>
@endverbatim

As a convention, please put @c @@note blocks after other text such as
parameter lists and general explanations.  Put @c @@warning blocks after any
@c @@note blocks, but put @c @@warning blocks @em before @c @@see blocks, and
put @c @@see very last in documentation.  Sometimes there are exceptional
situations were it's better to put warnings higher in the documentation of a
class or method, but in most cases, the sequence should be: @c @@note, @c
@@warning, and @c @@see.


@subsection coding-figures 4.5 Figures

Including images and other figures is a relatively simple matter.  Copy the file 
to the directory <code>docs/src/common-graphics/</code>, and then refer to it
in the text using the Doxygen command @c @@image.  This command takes three
arguments: the output type for which the image is to be used, the name of the
file, and a text string constituting the caption to be placed under the
image.  Here is an example:
@verbatim
 * @image html model-qualifiers.png "Relationship expressed by model qualifiers"
 * @image latex model-qualifiers.png "Relationship expressed by model qualifiers"
@endverbatim

Since we may at some point generate latex output, always use two @c @@image
commands when you use it: once with @c html and once with @c latex.



@section coding-doxygen-summary 5. Summary of commonly-used Doxygen commands in libSBML

The following is a summary of the doxygen commands we have found useful so
far in documenting libSBML.  This is only intended as a quick orientation;
they are illustrated in the other sections above, and the complete details
of their definitions and use can be found online at the <a
href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> website.

<table border="0" class="centered text-table width80 normal-font alt-row-colors">
<tr>
    <th align="left">Command</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>@c @@author</td>
<td>
Names the author of the entity being described (a file, a class, etc.).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@brief</td>
<td>
Provides a one-sentence description of the entity being described (a file,
a class, etc.).</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@bug</td>
<td>
Formats the following paragraph with the heading "Bugs:".  Useful to
indicate that something is known to be a problem in some part of the code. 
As a convention, please put @c @@bug blocks at the end of a documentation
block, for uniformity in the API documentation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@c</td>
<td>
Puts the following word in typewriter ("code") font.  To style more than one
word, use <code>&lt;code&gt;the words&lt;/code&gt;</code>.  If you need to
put something that contains HTML tags in typewriter font, use the
<code>&lt;code&gt;the words&lt;/code&gt;</code> form, and use the HTML
character codes <code>\&lt;</code> and<code>\&gt;</code> to embed the
opening '@c &lt;' and '@c &gt;' characters inside <code>the words</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@class</td>
<td>
Declares that the following documentation block refers to the named class.
Useful only when the block does not immediately precede the class
definition (e.g., when it's at the beginning of the file). 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@copydetails</td>
<td>
Copies the "detail" portion of the documentation of the given symbol.  Please
see Section @ref coding-copydetails for more information.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@em</td>
<td>
Puts the following word in italic font, for emphasis.  To put multiple words
in italics, use <code>&lt;em&gt;the words&lt;/em&gt;</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@enum</td>
<td>
Defines an enumeration.  Otherwise identical to @c @@class.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@file</td>
<td>
Defines the name of the current file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@htmlinclude</td>
<td>
Insert the contents of the named file.  The file can contain HTML 
formatting instructions.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@if ... @em symbol @c @@else ... @c @@endif</td>
<td>
Makes content visible depending on whether the @em symbol immediately
following the @c @@if is defined.  If it is defined, the text after the
symbol and before either the @c @@else (if it is present) or the @c @@endif
is used in the output.  <strong>Important:</strong> As noted above in Section
@ref coding-conditionals, Doxygen removes the white space surrounding the
text inside the conditional and after the @c @@endif.  This is problematic in
most situations, because it produces run-together text in the output.  We
believe this is a bug and have reported it, but as of Doxygen version 1.8.6,
the behavior persists.  To avoid the problem, use the following hack: unless
the next character after @c @@endif is a punctuation character or it is the
end of the text block, put the sequence <code>@@~</code> after the @c
@@endif.  In other words, write <code>@@endif@@~</code> in the input, rather
than a bare @c @@endif.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@li</td>
<td>
Starts (or continues) a bullet list.  You can insert the first @c @@li in
a comment, and the item will continue until a paragraph break or the
next @c @@li command.  (Note: even though Doxygen will also recognize
hyphens at the beginning of a line as starting a  list item, avoid using 
that approach in favor of the @c @@li command.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@p</td>
<td>
Puts the following word in typewriter ("code") font.  This form is preferred
when the word is a parameter to a method or function.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@param</td>
<td>
Declares a parameter to a method or function.  The first word following
@c @@param will be the name of the parameter, and the rest of the text (up to
a period or blank) will be used as the description.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@n</td>
<td>
Forces a newline, like HTML's <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@note</td>
<td>
Formats the following paragraph with the heading "Note:".  Useful to call
out something special about a class, function, file or other entity, such
as a behavior that should be brought to the attention of users or a note
about API changes compared to previous versions of the software or SBML.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@return</td>
<td>
Declares the return value from a method or function.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@sbmlbrief</td>
<td>
Special command defined for libSBML; see Section @ref coding-doc-h for 
more information.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@see</td>
<td>
Formats a reference to another entity in the documentation.  Commonly used
to refer to related classes or methods.  As a convention, please put @c @@see
blocks at the very end of a documentation block, for uniformity in the
API documentation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>@c @@warning</td>
<td>
Formats the following paragraph with the heading "Warning:".  This is a
stronger statement than @c @@note, and is useful to call attention to
backward-incompatible changes or potentially error-provoking situations.
As a convention, please put @c @@warning blocks after @c @@note blocks
in documentation, and please wrap them with
an HTML span element with the CSS class "warning".  (See discussion in
Section @ref coding-common-text.)
</td></tr>

Many HTML commands will work in comments for Doxygen.  For example, a
common one is the @c a tag for linking text to a URL, as in <code>&lt;a
href="http://sbml.org"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  Unfortunately, many
(most?) HTML commands will @em not work.  For those situations, you may have
to resort to using @c @@htmlinclude'ed raw HTML files.


@section coding-doc-process 6. The libSBML documentation-generation process

The sequence of events in generating the finished, formatted user
documentation is complex.  However, it can be useful to have a general sense
for how it works, to help find problems when the output produced is not
what's expected.  This section summarizes the sequences of events for the
different types of documentation.

@subsection doc-process-c 6.1 The sequence for generating C++ and C documentation

The steps below are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
<code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
cpp-manual</code> (for C++) or <code>make c-manual</code> (for C).

-# The process first generates a CSS stylesheet
   (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define formatting
   rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3 package
   extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules
   for every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with
   every SBML Level&nbsp;3 package class in the libSBML API documentation.

-# Next, Doxygen is executed @em twice.  This double run of Doxygen is
   necessary to use the @c @@ingroup command in the way we use it to produce
   pages that list all the classes associated with a given SBML Level&nbsp;3
   package.
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>In the first run of Doxygen, the definition of the macro @c
   @@sbmlbrief is altered so that it invokes the Doxygen command @c
   @@addindex with the name of the each libSBML Python class.  The results of
   this run are a number of JavaScript files produced by Doxygen (files
   like <code>navtreeindex.js</code>, <code>navtree.js</code>, etc.).  These
   files are saved aside temporarily while the next step is performed.

<li>In the second run of Doxygen, the definition of @c @@sbmlbrief is reverted
   to its normal form, in which it invokes the Doxygen command @c @@ingroup.
   This produces the pages in the section titled "Level 3 Extensions"
   in the final documentation.

<li>The (correct) index files produced in the first run of Doxygen are used
   to replace the (incorrect) index files from the second run.

</ol>
-# Finally, a number of unmodified additional files are copied to the
   destination directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and
   so on.

Without the double run of Doxygen described above, the left-hand table of
contents produced by Doxygen is dysfunctional.  If you encounter a broken
table of contents, then it may indicate something went wrong in the two-step
process described above.



@subsection doc-process-python 6.2 The sequence for generating Python documentation

The process for generating the Python API documentation is more involved than
the one for C++ and C documentation described above, though some parts are
the same.  The process for Python begins @em before you run <code>make
python-manual</code> in the <code>docs/src/</code> directory: it begins with
the process involving the execution of SWIG.  For completeness, the sequence
below encompasses this.

-# Before the documentation can be produced&mdash;that is, before the
   remaining steps below can be executed&mdash;the Python language interface
   code for libSBML must be generated.  This process is triggered by a
   regular <code>make</code> or <code>cmake</code> at the top level of the
   libSBML source code directory.  Unlike the other language bindings,
   however, the process for Python has extra complexity because two kinds of
   output have to be produced: one for use with Doxygen to generate the API
   documentation, and one for creating plain-text comment strings embedded
   with the Python code, which users will see when they use Python's
   interactive help facilities.  The steps involved can be summarized like
   this:
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>The Python program <code>rewrite_pydoc.py</code> in the subdirectory
   <code>src/bindings/python/doc-converter/</code> is executed.  This Python
   program reads all the libSBML source code files, copies the class and
   method comments found therein, performs pattern matching and substitution
   in the text of those comments to produce versions that follow Python
   documentation conventions, and finally, produces the file that will
   ultimately be used by SWIG when it creates the real language interface
   code.

<li>The Python program <code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code> is executed.
   Like the previous program, it also reads all the libSBML source code
   files, copies the class and method comments found therein, performs
   pattern matching and substitution in the text of those comments; however,
   it produces a @em different, temporary file that is fed to SWIG only to
   produce output for the next step.

<li>SWIG is executed once on the temporary file from the previous step to
   produce the file <code>src/bindings/python/libsbml-doxygen.py</code>.
   This will be the file used read by Doxygen to produce the formatted API
   documentation.

<li>SWIG is executed a second time on the output from
   <code>rewrite_doc.py</code> (explained above), to produce the actual
   Python binding definitions in
   <code>src/bindings/python/libsbml_wrap.cpp</code>.
</ol>
-# The remaining steps below to produce the formatted API documentation
   output are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
   <code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
   java-manual</code>. (Note that the steps @em above are always performed
   during a build of libSBML, regardless of whether you generate
   documentation.)

-# The <code>make python-manual</code> process first generates a CSS
   stylesheet (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define
   formatting rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3
   package extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by 
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules
   for every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with
   every SBML Level&nbsp;3 package in the libSBML API documentation.

-# Next, a substitution step is performed on the file produced by SWIG.  This
   substitution step is implemented by the Python program
   <code>pythondocpreprocessor.py</code> in <code>docs/src/</code>.  This
   program reads files found in <code>docs/src/python-substitutions</code>
   (each file is named after a libSBML Python class), and also reads the file
   <code>libsbml-doxygen.py</code> previously produced by SWIG in the
   <code>src/bindings/python/</code> directory (as described above).  For
   each file in the substitutions directory, the program takes the contents
   of that file and uses the comment strings found therein instead of the
   comment strings found for that same class in the SWIG-produced
   <code>libsbml-doxygen.py</code> file.  If a subtitution file exists for a
   class but is empty, then this has the effect of @em deleting that class
   from the documentation produced.  This admittedly complicated step has two
   roles: it adds documentation for classes only defined in the language
   bindings that we could not find another way to document directly (e.g.,
   for classes ASTNodeList, CVTermList, etc.), and second, it omits some
   internal classes from the API documentation.

-# Next, the <code>make python-manual</code> process in
   <code>docs/src/</code> runs Doxygen @em twice.  This double
   run of Doxygen is necessary to use the @c @@ingroup command in the way we
   use it to produce pages that list all the classes associated with a given
   SBML Level&nbsp;3 package.
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>In the first run of Doxygen, the definition of the macro @c
   @@sbmlbrief is altered so that it invokes the Doxygen command @c
   @@addindex with the name of the each libSBML Python class.  The results of
   this run are a number of JavaScript files produced by Doxygen (files
   like <code>navtreeindex.js</code>, <code>navtree.js</code>, etc.).  These
   files are saved aside temporarily while the next step is performed.

<li>In the second run of Doxygen, the definition of @c @@sbmlbrief is reverted
   to its normal form, in which it invokes the Doxygen command @c @@ingroup.
   This produces the pages in the section titled "Level 3 Extensions"
   in the final documentation.

<li>The (correct) index files produced in the first run of Doxygen are used
   to replace the (dysfunctional) index files from the second run.

</ol>
-# Finally, a number of unmodified additional files are copied to the
   destination directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and
   so on.


@subsection doc-process-java 6.3 The process for generating Java documentation

The process for the Java API documentation is different from all the others
because it does not use Doxygen; instead, it uses Javadoc, the common Java
documentation-generation tool.  In principle we @em could use Doxygen for
Java as well, but the output produced by Doxygen is different in appearance
and structure than what Javadoc produces.  We felt that using Javadoc would
provide something closer to what Java developers are accustomed to seeing,
and therefore would be better for Java developers.

The process for generating the Java API documentation actually begins @em
before you run <code>make java-manual</code> in the <code>docs/src/</code>
directory: it begins with the process involving the execution of SWIG.  For
completeness, the sequence below encompasses this.

-# Before the documentation can be produced&mdash;that is, before the
   remaining steps below can be executed&mdash;the Java bindings files for
   libSBML must be generated.  This process is triggered by a regular
   <code>make</code> or <code>cmake</code> at the top level of the libSBML
   source code directory.  It will invoke SWIG at some point, but before it
   invokes SWIG, it will run the custom Python program
   <code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code>.  This Python program reads all
   the libSBML source code files, copies the class and method comments found
   therein, performs pattern matching and substitution in the text of those
   comments to produce versions that follow Javadoc conventions, and writes
   the modified results to the file <code>src/bindings/java/javadoc.i</code>.
   This file will be read by SWIG when it runs.  When SWIG produces the
   actual Java files that it writes in
   <code>src/bindings/java/java-files/</code>, it uses the comment strings in
   this file as the source of the documentation strings attached to the Java
   class and method definitions.

-# The remaining steps below to produce the formatted API documentation
   output are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
   <code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
   java-manual</code>.  (Note that the steps @em above are always performed
   during a build of libSBML, regardless of whether you generate documentation.)

-# The <code>make java-manual</code> process first generates a CSS stylesheet
   (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define formatting
   rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3 package
   extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by 
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules for 
   every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with every
   package and written in places such as the left-hand list of class names in
   the Javadoc output.  (This complicated process is necessary because
   Javadoc provides no other hooks to modify the appearance of class
   description pages.)

-# The Java files previously produced by SWIG for the Java API are copied
   from their location in <code>src/bindings/java/java-files/</code> to a
   temporary directory in <code>docs/src</code>.

-# The Java files located in <code>docs/src/java-substitutions/</code> are
   copied into the same temporary directory as the previous step, @em
   overwriting some of the files originally created by SWIG.  These
   substitutions are necessary for various reasons, including the inability
   to attach documentation to some types of objects produced by SWIG.  The
   files in <code>docs/src/java-substitutions/</code> do not contain any Java
   code, only comments.  Two points are important to note.  First, the
   comments are in Javadoc format, @em not in Doxygen format, because the
   next step will feed the files as-is to Javadoc.  Second, if the original
   source code changes, <strong>the substitution files must be modified by
   hand</strong> to account for the changes.  This is an obvious maintenance
   problem, but we currently have no better solution.

-# Next, Javadoc is executed on the contents of the temporary directory
   mentioned in the previous step, to generate the basic HTML output files to
   the destination directory.  Javadoc is invoked with a custom doclet that
   implements features not available in the default Javadoc doclet, such as
   skipping internal SWIG methods with a certain name, detecting the tag @c
   @@internal in method comments and omitting those methods from the output,
   and adding some comments to some methods (at the moment, the
   <code>delete()</code> method).

-# A number of unmodified additional files are copied to the destination
   directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and so on.

-# A number of additional HTML files are copied from <code>docs/src/</code>
   to the destination directory, but using a procedure that prepends a
   header, appends a footer, and performs substitutions on variables in the
   files (for the title and the libSBML version number) to produce their
   final version in the output directory.  These files are for the front
   page of the API documentation, installation procedures, etc.; basically,
   content that is not class or method documentation.

-# The HTML page that lists the libSBML SBML Level&nbsp;3 extensions is
   generated using a Python program,
   <code>docs/src/generate-extensions-summary.py</code>. The file is
   generated by rewriting an HTML page generated by Javadoc.  The
   transformations include adding the color codes for different Level&nbsp;3
   packages.

-# All of the HTML files in the output directory are modified to insert a
   directive to include the <code>sbml.js</code> JavaScript file and to
   rewrite some of the text in the files (e.g., to remove the word "Package",
   which is a Java term that has a different meaning for SBML).

-# Finally, the Java example files are copied from
   <code>examples/java/</code> to a subdirectory in the destination output
   directory, along the way being modified to wrap them in HTML code.


@section coding-misc-doxygen 7. Miscellaneous Doxygen notes

The following are some notes and warnings that did not easily fit elsewhere
in this section.

@li The doxygen command @c @@internal is (according to the doxygen
documentation) supposed to let you flag things as internal implementation
code, such that it is not put in the finished documentation.  This would be
great if we could use it, but I (MH) have been unable to make this work.
(Yes, there is a configuration flag, and yes, I've tried setting it both
ways.)
