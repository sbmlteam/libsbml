<a name="details" id="details"></a><h2 class="groupheader">Detailed Description</h2>
<div class="textblock"> An SBML compartment, where species are located.</p>
<p>A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are located. Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual structures inside or outside of a biological cell.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the overall definition of <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a>, every species in an SBML model must be located in a compartment. This in turn means that if a model defines any species, the model must also define at least one compartment. The reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore must exist <em>somewhere</em>. Compartments represent the <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> has one required attribute, "id", to give the compartment a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to it. A compartment can also have an optional "name" attribute of type <code>string</code>. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> also has an optional attribute "spatialDimensions" that is used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the compartment. Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer values of "spatialDimensions" of <code>3</code> (i.e., a three-dimensional compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional compartment, a surface), or <code>1</code> (a one-dimensional compartment, a line). In SBML Level&#160;3, the type of this attribute is <code>double</code>, there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the "spatialDimensions" attribute, and there are no default values. In SBML Level&#160;2, the value must be a positive <code>integer</code>, and the default value is <code>3</code>; the permissible values in SBML Level&#160;2 are <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> (for a point).</p>
<p>Another optional attribute on <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> is "size", representing the <em>initial</em> total size of that compartment in the model. The "size" attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is one-dimensional). There is no default value of compartment size in SBML Level&#160;2 or Level&#160;3. In particular, a missing "size" value <em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>. (This is unlike the definition of compartment "volume" in SBML Level&#160;1.) When the compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute does not have a value of <code>0</code>, a missing value of "size" for a given compartment signifies that the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, <a class="el" href="class_algebraic_rule.html">AlgebraicRule</a> or <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a> object elsewhere in the model. In SBML Level&#160;2, there are additional special requirements on the values of "size"; we discuss them in a <a href="#comp-l2">separate section below</a>.</p>
<p>The units associated with a compartment's "size" attribute value may be set using the optional attribute "units". The rules for setting and using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&#160;2 and Level&#160;3, and are discussed separately below.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> attribute named "constant" is used to indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation begins. A value of <code>true</code> indicates the compartment's "size" cannot be changed by any other construct except <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>; a value of <code>false</code> indicates the compartment's "size" can be changed by other constructs in SBML. In SBML Level&#160;2, there is an additional explicit restriction that if "spatialDimensions"=<code>"0"</code>, the value cannot be changed by <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a> either. Further, in Level&#160;2, "constant" is optional, and has a default value of <code>true</code>. In SBML Level&#160;3, there is no default value for the "constant" attribute, and it is required.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="comp-l2"></a>
Additional considerations in SBML Level 2</h1>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;2, the default units of compartment size, and the kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute "units", interact with the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment. The value of the "units" attribute of a <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object must be one of the base units (see <a class="el" href="class_unit.html">Unit</a>), or the predefined unit identifiers <code>volume</code>, <code>area</code>, <code>length</code> or <code>dimensionless</code>, or a new unit defined by a <a class="el" href="class_unit_definition.html">UnitDefinition</a> object in the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a>, subject to the restrictions detailed in the following table:</p>

</table>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the "units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the default value listed in the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has a "spatialDimensions" value greater than <code>0</code>: </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">The value of the "units" attribute is used as the units of the compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The <code>math</code> element of an <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a> or <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a> referring to this compartment <em>must</em> (in Level&#160;2 Versions&#160;1-3) or <em>should</em> (in Level&#160;2 Version 4) have identical units.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">In <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a> objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's size, the units of the rule's <code>math</code> element <em>must</em> (in Level&#160;2 Versions&#160;1&ndash;3) or <em>should</em> (in Level&#160;2 Version 4) be identical to the compartment's units (whether defined by the "units" attribute or by taking the default value from the <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a>) divided by the default <em>time</em> units. (In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
When a <a class="el" href="class_species.html">Species</a> is to be treated in terms of concentrations or density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula <em>substance/<em>size</em>)</em> are those indicated by the value of the "units" attribute on the compartment in which the species is located. </li>
</ul>
<p>Compartments with "spatialDimensions"=<code>0</code> require special treatment in this framework. As implied above, the "size" attribute must not have a value on an SBML Level&#160;2 <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object if the "spatialDimensions" attribute has a value of <code>0</code>. An additional related restriction is that the "constant" attribute must default to or be set to <code>true</code> if the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute is <code>0</code>, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.</p>
<p>If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical formulas? The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no value, and its value cannot change. Note also that a zero-dimensional compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as concentration. Since SBML <a class="el" href="class_kinetic_law.html">KineticLaw</a> formulas are already in terms of <em>substance/<em>time</em> and</em> not (say) <em>concentration/<em>time</em>,</em> volume or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in zero-dimensional compartments.</p>
<p>Finally, in SBML Level&#160;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular compartment <em>type</em>. The optional attribute "compartmentType" is used identify the compartment type represented by the <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> structure. The "compartmentType" attribute's value must be the identifier of a <a class="el" href="class_compartment_type.html">CompartmentType</a> instance defined in the model. If the "compartmentType" attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no other compartment can belong to that compartment type. The values of "compartmentType" attributes on compartments have no effect on the numerical interpretation of a model. Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore "compartmentType" attributes. The "compartmentType" attribute and the <a class="el" href="class_compartment_type.html">CompartmentType</a> class of objects are not present in SBML Level&#160;3 Core nor in SBML Level&#160;1.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="comp-l3"></a>
Additional considerations in SBML Level 3</h1>
<p>One difference between SBML Level&#160;3 and lower Levels of SBML is that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the "spatialDimensions" attribute, and there is no default value defined for the attribute. The value of "spatialDimensions" does not have to be an integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing structures with fractal dimensions.</p>
<p>The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the numerical interpretation of a model. However, the value of "spatialDimensions" <em>does</em> affect the interpretation of the units associated with a compartment's size. Specifically, the value of "spatialDimensions" is used to select among the <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" when a <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> structure does not define a value for its "units" attribute.</p>
<p>The "units" attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> object instance. The applicable attribute on <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> depends on the value of the compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute; the relationship is shown in the table below. If the <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> object does not define the relevant attribute ("volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits") for a given "spatialDimensions" value, the unit associated with that <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object's size is undefined. If a given <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a>'s "units" are left unset and the "spatialDimensions" either has a value other than <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> or is left unset itself (as it has no default value), then no unit can be chosen from among the <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a>'s "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits" attributes (even if the <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> instance provides values for those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them. Leaving the units of compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment sizes.</p>

<p>The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as defined by the "units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the inherited value from <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> according to the table above, is used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is the value of the "units" attribute.</p>

<li>

<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">In a <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a> object that defines a rate of change for a compartment's size, the unit of the rule's "math" element should be identical to the compartment's "units" attribute divided by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>. (In other words, {<em>unit of compartment size</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.)</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="comp-other"></a>
Other aspects of Compartment</h1>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;1 and Level&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> has an optional attribute named "outside", whose value can be the identifier of another <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object defined in the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model.html">Model</a> object. Doing so means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it. This enables the representation of simple topological relationships between compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments). It is worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the "outside" attribute. The size of a given compartment does not in any sense include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their "outside" attributes. In other words, if a compartment <em>B</em> has the identifier of compartment <em>A</em> as its "outside" attribute value, the size of <em>A</em> does not include the size of <em>B</em>. The compartment sizes are separate.</p>
<p>In Level&#160;2, there are two restrictions on the "outside" attribute. First, because a compartment with "spatialDimensions" of <code>0</code> has no size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other compartment <em>except</em> compartments that <em>also</em> have "spatialDimensions" values of <code>0</code>. Second, the directed graph formed by representing <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> structures as vertexes and the "outside" attribute values as edges must be acyclic. The latter condition is imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself. In the absence of a value for "outside", compartment definitions in SBML Level&#160;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each other. </p>

Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this constructor.

This method should be used with some caution. The fact that this method <em>copies</em> the object passed to it means that the caller will be left holding a physically different object instance than the one contained inside this object. Changes made to the original object instance (such as resetting attribute values) will <em>not affect the instance in this object</em>. In addition, the caller should make sure to free the original object if it is no longer being used, or else a memory leak will result. Please see other methods on this class (particularly a corresponding method whose name begins with the word <code>create</code>) for alternatives that do not lead to these issues. </dd></dl>

A given model may indicate that it uses one or more SBML packages, and likewise, a software tool may be able to support one or more packages. LibSBML does not come preconfigured with all possible packages included and enabled, in part because not all package specifications have been finalized. To support the ability for software systems to enable support for the Level&#160;3 packages they choose, libSBML features a <em>plug-in</em> mechanism. Each SBML Level&#160;3 package is implemented in a separate code plug-in that can be enabled by the application to support working with that SBML package. A given SBML model may thus contain not only objects defined by SBML Level&#160;3 Core, but also objects created by libSBML plug-ins supporting additional Level&#160;3 packages.</dd></dl>

<p>Disables the given SBML Level&#160;3 package on this object. </p>
<p>This method disables the specified package on this object and other objects connected by child-parent links in the same <a class="el" href="class_s_b_m_l_document.html">SBMLDocument</a> object.</p>
<p>An example of when this may be useful is during construction of model components when mixing existing and new models. Suppose your application read an SBML document containing a model that used the SBML Hierarchical Model Composition (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package, and extracted parts of that model in order to construct a new model in memory. The new, in-memory model will not accept a component drawn from an other <a class="el" href="class_s_b_m_l_document.html">SBMLDocument</a> with different package namespace declarations. You could reconstruct the same namespaces in the in-memory model first, but as a shortcut, you could also disable the package namespace on the object being added.

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The column number for each construct in an SBML model is set upon reading the model. The accuracy of the column number depends on the correctness of the XML representation of the model, and on the particular XML parser library being used. The former limitation relates to the following problem: if the model is actually invalid XML, then the parser may not be able to interpret the data correctly and consequently may not be able to establish the real column number. The latter limitation is simply that different parsers seem to have their own accuracy limitations, and out of all the parsers supported by libSBML, none have been 100% accurate in all situations. (At this time, libSBML supports the use of <a href="http://xmlsoft.org" target="_blank">libxml2</a>, <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Expat</a> and <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/" target="_blank">Xerces</a>.)</dd></dl>

<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>SBML Level&#160;3 consists of a <em>Core</em> definition that can be extended via optional SBML Level&#160;3 <em>packages</em>. A given model may indicate that it uses one or more SBML packages, and likewise, a software tool may be able to support one or more packages. LibSBML does not come preconfigured with all possible packages included and enabled, in part because not all package specifications have been finalized. To support the ability for software systems to enable support for the Level&#160;3 packages they choose, libSBML features a <em>plug-in</em> mechanism. Each SBML Level&#160;3 package is implemented in a separate code plug-in that can be enabled by the application to support working with that SBML package. A given SBML model may thus contain not only objects defined by SBML Level&#160;3 Core, but also objects created by libSBML plug-ins supporting additional Level&#160;3 packages.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>If a plugin is <em>disabled</em>, the package information it contains is no longer considered to be part of the SBML document for the purposes of searching the document or writing out the document. However, the information is still retained, so if the plugin is enabled again, the same information will once again be available, and will be written out to the final model.</dd></dl>

<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a> would always return an empty string, and <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a8a1c2b5aa36c18639f95cdb357dd3c98" title="Predicate returning true if this Compartment object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetId()</a> would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (<a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#ad5ffefa4d9901ca0d55f2343c08bb057" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">getIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a8a342a0f8387842fb6700c50c4c43344" title="Sets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">setIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a9fb99b60d2f2f0427e818187cc6f6ad9" title="Predicate returning true if this object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetIdAttribute()</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a1bfd93ef72d0f624964fcfd7a8d5cdfb" title="Unsets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">unsetIdAttribute()</a>) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a>/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary. Regardless of the Level and Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers).

<p>Returns the value of the "name" attribute of this <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object. </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, the "id" and "name" attributes were moved to <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> directly, instead of being defined individually for many (but not all) objects. LibSBML has for a long time provided functions defined on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object for which those attributes were not defined. Now that all <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> objects define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with the appropriate level and version.</dd></dl>
<p>The "name" attribute is optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes within a model. Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable label for the component. The data type of "name" is the type <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema. SBML imposes no restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.</p>
<p>The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows. If a software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name" attributes, it should display this content to the user as a component's label instead of the component's "id". If the user interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name" attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface should display the value of the "id" attribute instead. (Script language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of "name".)</p>
<p>As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems may display the "id"'s to the user. Authors therefore may wish to take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a) reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated form of the name attribute value.</p>
<p>An additional point worth mentioning is although there are restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model. This allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have names). If the object in question does not posess a "name" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or write "name" attributes for those objects.</p>

However, the content cannot be <em>entirely</em> free-form; it must satisfy certain requirements defined in the <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications" target="_blank">SBML specifications</a> for specific SBML Levels. To help verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static utility method <a class="el" href="class_syntax_checker.html#ade6c33a7180bbc7bc70b4421b917a7b0" title="Returns true or false depending on whether the given XMLNode object contains valid XHTML content.">SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax()</a>; this method implements a verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a given <a class="el" href="class_x_m_l_node.html">XMLNode</a> object conforms to the SBML requirements for "notes" and "message" structure.

<p>Returns the MIRIAM <em>biological qualifier</em> associated with the given resource. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://biomodels.net/miriam" target="_blank">MIRIAM</a>, qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the relationship between a model component and its annotations. There are two broad kinds of annotations: <em>model</em> and <em>biological</em>.

Examples of relationships include "is" and "has part", but many others are possible.

<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a> would always return an empty string, and <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a8a1c2b5aa36c18639f95cdb357dd3c98" title="Predicate returning true if this Compartment object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetId()</a> would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (<a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#ad5ffefa4d9901ca0d55f2343c08bb057" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">getIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a8a342a0f8387842fb6700c50c4c43344" title="Sets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">setIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a9fb99b60d2f2f0427e818187cc6f6ad9" title="Predicate returning true if this object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetIdAttribute()</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a1bfd93ef72d0f624964fcfd7a8d5cdfb" title="Unsets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">unsetIdAttribute()</a>) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a>/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.

<p>The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows. If a software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name" attributes, it should display this content to the user as a component's label instead of the component's "id". If the user interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name" attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface should display the value of the "id" attribute instead. (Script language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of "name".)</p>
<p>As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems may display the "id"'s to the user. Authors therefore may wish to take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a) reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated form of the name attribute value.</p>
<p>An additional point worth mentioning is although there are restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model. This allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have names). If the object in question does not posess a "name" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or write "name" attributes for those objects.</p>

<p>Predicate returning <code>true</code> if this object's "notes" subelement exists and has content. </p>
<p>The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML component type, is intended as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed. Every object derived directly or indirectly from type <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> can have a separate value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their models.</p>
<p>The format of "notes" elements must be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank">XHTML&#160;1.0</a>. To help verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static utility method <a class="el" href="class_syntax_checker.html#ade6c33a7180bbc7bc70b4421b917a7b0" title="Returns true or false depending on whether the given XMLNode object contains valid XHTML content.">SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax()</a>; however, readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications" target="_blank">SBML specification document</a> for the Level and Version of their model for more in-depth explanations. The SBML Level&#160;2 and&#160;3 specifications have considerable detail about how "notes" element content must be structured.</p>

<p>In SBML, object identifiers are of a data type called <code>SId</code>.

These and other methods of libSBML refer to the type <code>SIdRef</code> for all Levels of SBML, even if the corresponding SBML specification did not explicitly name the data type.</p>
<p>This method works by looking at all attributes and (if appropriate) mathematical formulas in MathML content, comparing the referenced identifiers to the value of <code>oldid</code>. If any matches are found, the matching values are replaced with <code>newid</code>. The method does <em>not</em> descend into child elements.</p>

<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a> would always return an empty string, and <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a8a1c2b5aa36c18639f95cdb357dd3c98" title="Predicate returning true if this Compartment object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetId()</a> would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (<a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#ad5ffefa4d9901ca0d55f2343c08bb057" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">getIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a8a342a0f8387842fb6700c50c4c43344" title="Sets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">setIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a9fb99b60d2f2f0427e818187cc6f6ad9" title="Predicate returning true if this object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetIdAttribute()</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a1bfd93ef72d0f624964fcfd7a8d5cdfb" title="Unsets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">unsetIdAttribute()</a>) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a>/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary. Regardless of the Level and Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers). If the object in question does not posess an "id" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the identifier to be set, nor will it read or write "id" attributes for those objects.</p>

   </pre> The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the character <code>*</code> "zero or more times", and the character <code>|</code> indicates logical "or". The equality of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner. This applies to all uses of <code>SId</code>, <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.</dd></dl>
<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a> would always return an empty string, and <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a8a1c2b5aa36c18639f95cdb357dd3c98" title="Predicate returning true if this Compartment object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetId()</a> would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (<a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#ad5ffefa4d9901ca0d55f2343c08bb057" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">getIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a8a342a0f8387842fb6700c50c4c43344" title="Sets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">setIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a9fb99b60d2f2f0427e818187cc6f6ad9" title="Predicate returning true if this object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetIdAttribute()</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a1bfd93ef72d0f624964fcfd7a8d5cdfb" title="Unsets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">unsetIdAttribute()</a>) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a>/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary. Regardless of the Level and Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers). If the object in question does not posess an "id" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the identifier to be set, nor will it read or write "id" attributes for those objects.</p>

Although SBML itself specifies the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML <code>ID</code></a> only for the "metaid" attribute, SBML-compatible applications should be careful if they use XML <code>ID</code>'s in XML portions of a model that are not defined by SBML, such as in the application-specific content of the "annotation" subelement.

<p>The content of <code>notes</code> is copied, and any existing content of this object's "notes" subelement is deleted.</p>
<p>The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML component type, is intended as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed. Every object derived directly or indirectly from type <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> can have a separate value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their models.</p>
<p>The format of "notes" elements must be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank">XHTML&#160;1.0</a>. To help verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static utility method <a class="el" href="class_syntax_checker.html#ade6c33a7180bbc7bc70b4421b917a7b0" title="Returns true or false depending on whether the given XMLNode object contains valid XHTML content.">SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax()</a>; however, readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications" target="_blank">SBML specification document</a> for the Level and Version of their model for more in-depth explanations. The SBML Level&#160;2 and&#160;3 specifications have considerable detail about how "notes" element content must be structured.</p>
<p>The following code illustrates a very simple way of setting the notes using this method.

<p>Sets the value of the "notes" subelement of this SBML object. </p>
<p>The content of <code>notes</code> is copied, and any existing content of this object's "notes" subelement is deleted.</p>
<p>The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML component type, is intended as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed. Every object derived directly or indirectly from type <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> can have a separate value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their models.</p>
<p>The format of "notes" elements must be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank">XHTML&#160;1.0</a>. To help verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static utility method <a class="el" href="class_syntax_checker.html#ade6c33a7180bbc7bc70b4421b917a7b0" title="Returns true or false depending on whether the given XMLNode object contains valid XHTML content.">SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax()</a>; however, readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications" target="_blank">SBML specification document</a> for the Level and Version of their model for more in-depth explanations.

<p>Unsets the value of the "id" attribute of this SBML object. </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The identifier given by an object's "id" attribute value is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition. Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier. The data type of "id" is always <code>SId</code> or a type derived from that, such as <code>UnitSId</code>, depending on the object in question. All data types are defined as follows: <pre style="margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black">
     letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
     digit  ::= '0'..'9'
     idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
     SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
   </pre> The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the character <code>*</code> "zero or more times", and the character <code>|</code> indicates logical "or". The equality of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner. This applies to all uses of <code>SId</code>, <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.</dd></dl>
<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment.html">InitialAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule.html">AssignmentRule</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule.html">RateRule</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a> would always return an empty string, and <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a8a1c2b5aa36c18639f95cdb357dd3c98" title="Predicate returning true if this Compartment object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetId()</a> would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (<a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#ad5ffefa4d9901ca0d55f2343c08bb057" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">getIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a8a342a0f8387842fb6700c50c4c43344" title="Sets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">setIdAttribute()</a>, <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a9fb99b60d2f2f0427e818187cc6f6ad9" title="Predicate returning true if this object&#39;s &quot;id&quot; attribute is set.">isSetIdAttribute()</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html#a1bfd93ef72d0f624964fcfd7a8d5cdfb" title="Unsets the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this SBML object.">unsetIdAttribute()</a>) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html#a2cb2f7f7c0f856c3e767ebeedaf9f1b4" title="Returns the value of the &quot;id&quot; attribute of this Compartment.">getId()</a>/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary. Regardless of the Level and Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers). If the object in question does not posess an "id" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the identifier to be set, nor will it read or write "id" attributes for those objects.</p>

<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The optional attribute named "metaid", present on every major SBML component type, is for supporting metadata annotations using RDF (<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Format</a>).

The latter point is important, because the uniqueness criterion applies across <em>any</em> attribute with type <code>ID</code> anywhere in the file, not just the "metaid" attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to be aware of if your application-specific XML content inside the "annotation" subelement happens to use the XML <code>ID</code> type. Although SBML itself specifies the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML <code>ID</code></a> only for the "metaid" attribute, SBML-compatible applications should be careful if they use XML <code>ID</code>'s in XML portions of a model that are not defined by SBML, such as in the application-specific content of the "annotation" subelement. Finally, note that LibSBML does not provide an explicit XML <code>ID</code> data type; it uses ordinary character strings, which is easier for applications to support.</dd></dl>

<p>Unsets the value of the "name" attribute of this <a class="el" href="class_compartment.html">Compartment</a> object. </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, the "id" and "name" attributes were moved to <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> directly, instead of being defined individually for many (but not all) objects. LibSBML has for a long time provided functions defined on <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object for which those attributes were not defined. Now that all <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> objects define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with the appropriate level and version.</dd></dl>
<p>The "name" attribute is optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes within a model. Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable label for the component. The data type of "name" is the type <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema. SBML imposes no restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.</p>
<p>The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows. If a software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name" attributes, it should display this content to the user as a component's label instead of the component's "id". If the user interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name" attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface should display the value of the "id" attribute instead. (Script language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of "name".)</p>
<p>As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems may display the "id"'s to the user. Authors therefore may wish to take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a) reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated form of the name attribute value.</p>
<p>An additional point worth mentioning is although there are restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model. This allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have names). If the object in question does not posess a "name" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or write "name" attributes for those objects.</p>

<p>Unsets the value of the "notes" subelement of this SBML object. </p>
<p>The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML component type, is intended as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed. Every object derived directly or indirectly from type <a class="el" href="class_s_base.html">SBase</a> can have a separate value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their models.</p>
<p>The format of "notes" elements must be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank">XHTML&#160;1.0</a>. To help verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static utility method <a class="el" href="class_syntax_checker.html#ade6c33a7180bbc7bc70b4421b917a7b0" title="Returns true or false depending on whether the given XMLNode object contains valid XHTML content.">SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax()</a>; however, readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications" target="_blank">SBML specification document</a> for the Level and Version of their model for more in-depth explanations. The SBML Level&#160;2 and&#160;3 specifications have considerable detail about how "notes" element content must be structured.</p>
