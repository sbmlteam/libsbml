## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ installers for Mac OS X operating systems**

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Perl and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML for Mac OS X systems.  They were built with the Apple-supplied version of the [http://www.xmlsoft.org](libxml2) parser library, and include accepted SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Perl
* Ruby
	

By default, the installer will put libSBML into /usr.  Detailed information about how to make libSBML accessible to your software [is available on a separate web page](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_R source package_**

A source package for the libSBML R interface is available [here](../../R%20interface).  This is **not** included in the main installers.

### **_MATLAB interface_**

[The main directory named "MATLAB interface"](../../MATLAB%20interface) contains the standalone binaries for the MATLAB libSBML interface **only**. This is **not** included in the main installers.

### **_Python installer_**

If you are primarily interested in Python, you can use the following command to install libSBML for Python:

```
sudo pip install python-libsbml
```

After you have installed the Python libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/python-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_Javascript/PHP interfaces_**

We do provide support for these languages but it will be necessary to build them for your system (see [Additional information](#add) below).

### **_How to uninstall libSBML_**

To uninstall libSBML, please run the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh
```

(If you chose to install libSBML into a directory tree other than `/usr/local`, then please look for the `uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh` script in the `bin` directory of that alternate location.)


### **_Additional information_**
[add]:l

If you need to use a different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The procedure is described in [the libSBML documentation](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-installation.html).  The source and documentation are available from the top-level download directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@).

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see the documentation or [visit the libSBML website](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!
