## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ installers for 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems**

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, MATLAB, Perl, and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ for 64-bit Microsoft Windows systems.  They were built with the libxml2 parser library, and include accepted SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Javascript
* MATLAB
* Perl
* Ruby
	
Here you will find the following files:

* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe) -- Complete libSBML binary distribution.

* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-fbc-x64.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-fbc-x64.exe) -- Installer for the MATLAB libSBML interface **only**.  Download this if you **only** need to use libSBML from MATLAB.  (This installer is also contained within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe), so if you downloaded that one, you do _not_ need this one too.) This MATLAB interface supports SBML core and the SBML Level 3 FBC package only.

To use these installers, download the appropriate file to your computer, then run the file, and follow the instructions displayed by the installer program on your screen.


### **_Python installer_**

The [Python folder](Python) contains installers for the Python libSBML interface **only**.  Download and use one of these installers if you **only** need the Python interface.  (The interface is also included within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x64.exe), so if you downloaded that one, you do _not_ need this one too.)

### **_R installer_***

The [R interface](R%20interface) folder contains installer for the R libSBML interface **only**.
