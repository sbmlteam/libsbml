###Installers for 32-bit Linux operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination before you install libSBML using this installer,
or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components
on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for 32-bit Linux systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2 XML
parser library.  The installer provides only the core libSBML library
(C/C++ interface); it does not include the other language bindings.

Here you will find the following files:

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm) -- for RPM-based Linux distributions
                                 (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb) -- for Debian-based Linux distributions
                                 (Ubuntu & its variants, Debian)

By default, the installer will put the contents in /usr/local.

If you need the MATLAB or other language interfaces, or need to use a
different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML
yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration
flags.  The procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The
source and documentation are available from the top-level download
directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/)
