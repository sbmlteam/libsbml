##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
###Installers for Mac OS X operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination before you install libSBML using this installer,
or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components
on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for Mac OS X systems.  All were built with the Apple-supplied libxml2
library, and contain the following libSBML language interfaces in
addition to the C/C++ libSBML core:

  * C# (Mono)
  * Java
  * Perl
  * Python
  * Ruby

The MATLAB and Octave interfaces are currently not included in the
MacOSX installer.  If you need the MATLAB and/or Octave interfaces, or
need to use a different XML parser library, it will be necessary to
build libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable
configuration flags.  The procedure is described in the libSBML
documentation.  The source and docs are available from the download
directory [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/)

By default, the installer will put the contents in /usr/local, but
this location can be changed from the installer interface.

To uninstall libSBML, please run the following command in your
terminal:

	sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh

(If you chose to install libSBML into a directory tree other than
`/usr/local`, then please look for the `uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh` script
in the "bin" directory of that alternate location.)

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see
the files in the `docs` subdirectory of this installer or visit the
libSBML website at
