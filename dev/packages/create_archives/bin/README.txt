In order to integrate this package with the libSBML 5, simply 
extract it over the existing libsbml source tree. 

Next re-run cmake and enable the package you integrated. For example to 
enable the groups package select ENABLE_GROUPS from the cmake-gui program. 
From the command line you would add -DENABLE_GROUPS=ON to your cmake 
options.
