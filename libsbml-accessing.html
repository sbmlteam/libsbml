<div class="textblock"><p>Once the libSBML files are installed, you may need to take additional steps so that software applications can <em>find</em> the libSBML library files at run time. This section provides information about how to do that.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="config-search-path"></a>
1. Setting your library search path</h1>
<p> Installing libSBML puts copies of the libSBML native object files in
appropriate destinations on your computer.  (By "native object files", we
mean files such as <code>libsbml.so</code>, <code>libsbml.5.dylib</code>,
<code>libsbml.dll</code>, etc.)  On Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, this should be
enough; a software application should be able to find the libSBML library
file(s) when it runs.  On Linux and Windows, that may not be enough to let a
software application find the libSBML library files&mdash;you may need to
take additional steps.  This may be the case even if your application can
find other libSBML components such as the language-specific interface 
(e.g., the libSBML JAR file in the Java case, or the <code>libsbml.py</code>
file in the Python case).

<p> If your run-time environment and the run-time environment for your
software applications do not know to look in the directory where libSBML was
installed, programs that require libSBML will fail to run and report errors
about being unable to find libSBML.

<h3>How to configure most Linux platforms</h3>

<p>There are two common approaches to solving the problem under Linux.

<ol>

<li><em>Using <code>ldconfig</code></em>: Run the program <code>ldconfig</code>
as user 'root' on your computer.  (Please consult the man page for
<code>ldconfig</code> if this is unfamiliar.)  This will configure the system
for all users.</li>

<li><em>Setting environment variables</em>: Ensure that each user sets the
environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in their terminal shells.
If you downloaded a ready-to-run libSBML installer, the default where the
libSBML library is installed is <nobr><code>/usr/local/lib</code></nobr>.  If
you built libSBML yourself using CMake, the path consists of
<code>/lib</code> appended to the value used for the
<nobr><code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code></nobr> configuration variable.  If
you built libSBML using GNU make, the path is <nobr><span
class="placeholder">DIR</span><code>/lib</code></nobr>, where <span
class="placeholder">DIR</span> is the value used for the configuration option
<nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span class="placeholder">DIR</span></nobr>.

<p> For example, suppose you used the default installation prefix
<code><nobr>/usr/local/</nobr></code>.  Then in csh-based command shells
under Linux, you may have to set the variable as follows (perhaps in your
<code>.cshrc</code> file):

<pre class="fragment">
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib
</pre>
</li>

</ol>


<h3>How to configure Microsoft Windows platforms:</h3>

<p>Set the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to include the
directory of the libSBML native library.  To set an environmental variable
in Windows, use the <em>System</em> option in the Windows <em>Control
Panel</em>.
</dd>
</dt>
</dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="config-software"></a>
2. Linking with or importing libSBML</h1>
<p>Once your library search path is configured so that processes on your computer can find the libSBML library files, the last step is to link or import libSBML into your software application. Different steps apply to different interface languages.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="config-import-c"></a>
C++ and C</h2>
<p> Compiling C++ or C software to use libSBML is usually a matter of
supplying certain options during compilation and linking.  Let <span
class="placeholder">DIR</span> stand for the directory used during the <a
href="libsbml-installation.html">libSBML configuration step</a> as the value
of the <nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span
class="placeholder">DIR</span></nobr> option (if you used
<code>configure</code> to configure libSBML) or
<code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> (if you used <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>).  There are two main sets of settings
on Unix-like systems such as Linux:

<ul>
<li> The flag <nobr><code>-I<span
class="placeholder">DIR</span>/include</code></nobr> needs to be supplied to
the compiler.  In addition, it may be necessary to supply a second
<nobr><code>-I</code></nobr> flag with the directory containing the include
files of the XML parser being used by libSBML.  For example, if you are using
the Xerces XML parser and you compiled and installed Xerces in
<code>/usr/local</code>, then when compiling your software to use libSBML,
you will also need to add the flag
<nobr><code>-I/usr/local/include</code></nobr>.

<p>

<li> The flags <nobr><code>-L<span class="placeholder">DIR</span>/lib -lsbml
-lstdc++ -lm</nobr></code> need to be supplied to 
the compiler or linker.  In addition, you may need to supply a corresponding
<nobr><code>-L</code></nobr> flag value to tell the linker where to find the XML
parser library being used by libSBML.
</ul>

<p> If you have the <nobr><code>pkg-config</code></nobr> utility, the steps above
can be substantially simplified.  First, make sure that your
<code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable includes the path to
the directory <span class="placeholder">DIR</span><code>/lib/pkgconfig</code> (which is the
directory where the file <code>libsbml.pc</code> will be installed by
libSBML's <code>make install</code> step).  Then, you can run
<nobr><code>pkg-config</code></nobr> with the <nobr><code>--cflags</code></nobr> and/or
<nobr><code>--libs</code></nobr> flags in your compilation/linking command.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="fragment">
g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs libsbml` myprogram.cpp
</pre>

<p> Note the use of the backward quote in the shell command above; it
has the effect of running the command <code><nobr>pkg-config</nobr> <nobr>--cflags</nobr>
<nobr>--libs</nobr> libsbml</code> and substituting in place the flags returned by
the command.
<h2><a class="anchor" id="config-import-csharp"></a>
C#</h2>
<p> The C# interface for libSBML is implemented partly as pure C# and partly
as native code.  To use it in an application, an additional step must be
performed after libSBML is installed and the your library search path is set
as described above.  The step is to place the managed library
<code>libsbmlcsP.dll</code> into your application's directory</h4>.

<p> C# applications need to be compiled by referencing the managed library
<code>libsbmlcsP.dll</code>.  This will also copy this managed library into
the application's output directory. Once the managed library is referenced,
and the native library can be found in the <code>PATH</code> (or, on Windows
systems, if it is in the same directory as the executable), the C# bindings
can be used in any .Net language program by simply including the libSBML
namespace.  The following C# code fragment illustrates how to use the
namespace:

<pre class="fragment">
using namespace libsbml;
</pre>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="config-import-java"></a>
Java</h2>
<p> The Java interface for libSBML is implemented partly as pure Java and
partly as Java Native Interface (JNI) code.  To use it in an application,
additional steps must be taken after libSBML is installed on your computer.

<h4>Step 1: (maybe) set the run-time library search path</h4>

<p> If you used the binary installers we provide for libSBML, or configured
your system's library search path manually, applications should be able to
find the libSBML library files at run time.  If this is not the case, you can
explicitly tell your Java interpreter where to find libSBML by setting the
flag <nobr><code>-Djava.library.path</code></nobr> to the directory
containing the libSBML library files.  (This directory is the one containing
the <code>.jnilib</code>, <code>.dylib</code> and/or <code>.dll</code> files
for libSBML, depending on the operating system&mdash;<em>not</em> the JAR
file.)

<p> For example, suppose that you configured libSBML to be installed into
<code>/usr/local</code> on a Linux system.  Then, you could start your
application using a command that begins as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
java  -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib  -cp .:/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar  <span class="placeholder">APPLICATION</span>
</pre></li>

<p> If the library search path is <em>not</em> set correctly, applications
will encounter a <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</code> at run time when
they attempt to call <code>System.loadLibrary("sbmlj")</code> (discussed in
Step&nbsp;3 below).  Here is an example of such an error message printed by
the Java interpreter:

<pre class="fragment">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no libsbmlj in java.library.path
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1764)
	at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:823)
	at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1044)
	at test.<clinit>(test.java:31)
</pre>


<h4>Step 2: set your application's Java class search path</h4>

<p> Java applications separately <strong>also</strong> need to have their
class search paths set up such that they include the libSBML
<code>.jar</code> file.  This is often most easily done by setting the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, but other methods are possible.
The exact recipe also depends on the operating system in use, as follows:

<ul>

<li><em>Java on Linux, Mac&nbsp;OS X and similar Unix-like systems:</em>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"> You must either (1) set your
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable to include the <code>.jar</code>
file, or (2) the libSBML <code>.jar</code> file must be listed in the
<nobr><code>-classpath</code></nobr> option passed to the Java interpreter
when it is started.  As an example of the former approach, if you had
configured libSBML to be installed into <code>/usr/local</code>, the
<code>libsbmlj.jar</code> file will end up as
<code>/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar</code> on Linux and
Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and your environment variable would at minimum need to be
set as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
  CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar
</pre>
</li>

<li><em>Java on Windows systems:</em>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"> The instructions are essentially the same as
for the case of Linux and similar systems, although the syntax for setting
environment variables is slightly different.  For example, if you had
installed libSBML into <code>C:\libsbml</code> on your system, you might set
your environment variable as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
  CLASSPATH=.;C:\libsbml\libsbmlj.jar
</pre>

<p> Note: to set an environmental variable in Windows, use the
<em>System</em> option in the Control Panel.

</li>
</ul>

<p> If the Java class search path is <em>not</em> set, then your application
will encounter a <code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException</code> error at run
time when it first attempts to access a libSBML class.  Here is an example
of such an error message:

<pre class="fragment">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/sbml/libsbml/XMLOutputStream
	at test.main(test.java:15)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sbml.libsbml.XMLOutputStream
	at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)
	at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)
	at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
	at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)
	... 1 more
</pre>


<h4>Step 3: load the libSBML JNI library in the application</h4>

<p> Finally, because of how JNI works in Java, an explicit call to
<code>System.loadLibrary</code> is needed in an application to load the
native language library portion of libSBML.  This involves putting a Java
<code>static</code> block of code somewhere in your application, usually in
the application's main class.  The following is an example of the minimum
code for doing this:

<pre class="fragment"><span style="color: #777">import org.sbml.libsbml.*;

public class YourMainApplicationClass
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    /* Whatever your application does here ... */
  }
</span>
  /**
   * The following static block is needed in order to load the
   * libSBML Java interface library when the application starts.
   */
  static
  {
      System.loadLibrary("sbmlj");
  }
}
</pre>

<p> For real applications, it is often useful to catch run-time exceptions
and try to interpret the causes on users' behalf.  The following is a more
elaborate example of code to load libSBML that tries to catch exceptions at
run-time, interpret their meaning, and provide informative error messages
about their causes.  (Note that the following is an entirely optional
replacement for the simpler version above.)

<pre class="fragment"><span style="color: #777">import org.sbml.libsbml.*;
public class YourMainApplicationClass
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    /* Whatever your application does here ... */
  }
</span>
  /**
   * The following static block is needed in order to load the
   * libSBML Java interface library when the application starts.
   */
  static
  {
    try
    {
      System.loadLibrary("sbmlj");
      // For extra safety, check that the jar file is in the classpath.
      Class.forName("org.sbml.libsbml.libsbml");
    }
    catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error encountered while attempting to load libSBML:");
      System.err.println("Please check the value of your "
                         + (System.getProperty("os.name").startsWith("Mac OS")
                            ? "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" : "LD_LIBRARY_PATH") +
                         " environment variable and/or your" +
                         " 'java.library.path' system property (depending on" +
                         " which one you are using) to make sure it list the" +
                         " directories needed to find the " +
                         System.mapLibraryName("sbmlj") + " library file and" +
                         " libraries it depends upon (e.g., the XML parser).");
      System.exit(1);
    }
    catch (ClassNotFoundException e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error: unable to load the file 'libsbmlj.jar'." +
                         " It is likely that your -classpath command line " +
                         " setting or your CLASSPATH environment variable " +
                         " do not include the file 'libsbmlj.jar'.");
      e.printStackTrace();

      System.exit(1);
    }
    catch (SecurityException e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error encountered while attempting to load libSBML:");
      e.printStackTrace();
      System.err.println("Could not load the libSBML library files due to a"+
                         " security exception.\n");
      System.exit(1);
    }
  }
<span style="color: #777">
}</span>
</pre>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="config-import-javascript"></a>
JavaScript</h2>
<p> The libSBML JavaScript interface is currently only designed to be used
with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.  After you
have installed libSBML on your system, you may need to perform one more step
to enable you and your users to access libSBML from Node.js: inform Node.js
where to find the libSBML module.  One approach to doing this is to set the
<nobr><code>NODE_PATH</code></nobr> environment variable to the location of
where the libSBML module is installed.  The value of
<nobr><code>NODE_PATH</code></nobr> depends on the installation directory
used during the <a href="libsbml-installation.html">libSBML configuration
step</a>.  If you built libSBML yourself using CMake, the path is
<nobr><code>/lib/node</code></nobr> appended to the value used for the
<nobr><code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code></nobr> configuration variable.  If
you built libSBML using GNU make, the path is <nobr><span
class="placeholder">DIR</span><code>/lib/node</code></nobr>, where <span
class="placeholder">DIR</span> is the value used for the configuration option
<nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span class="placeholder">DIR</span></nobr>.
Once the <nobr><code>NODE_PATH</code></nobr> environment variable is set,
Node.js should be able to access the libSBML module very simply as in the
following example:

<pre class="fragment">
var sbml = require('sbml')
</pre>

<p> Alternatively, if setting the environment variable
<nobr><code>NODE_PATH</code></nobr> is inconvenient, you can supply a full
path to the Node <code>require</code> statement to load the libSBML module:

<pre class="fragment">
var sbml = require('/usr/local/lib/node/sbml')
</pre>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="config-import-matlab"></a>
MATLAB</h2>
<p> The instructions for MATLAB depend on the operating system you are using.

<h4>MATLAB on Linux, Mac&nbsp;OS X and similar Unix-like systems</h4>

<p> The installation directory is also the same one where the additional
files <code>TranslateSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>,
<code>OutputSBML</code>.<em>extension</em> and <code>CheckAndConvert.m</code>
will have been placed.  These files implement the MATLAB interface to
libSBML.  On Linux and Unix-based systems including Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, the
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>/<code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
variable may need to be set in the terminal shell from which MATLAB is
started prior to starting MATLAB.  (Otherwise, MATLAB itself will not "see"
the value of the variable.)

<p class="warning">
Important: some versions of MATLAB produced for Linux include a version of
the stdc++ library that conflicts with the version provided by the operating 
system, causing a mystifying error when MATLAB tries to run or compile code
involving libSBML.  Please see the <a
href="libsbml-issues.html#matlab-linux">section in the <em>Known Issues</em>
document</a> for more information. </p>

<p> An additional step is necessary in the MATLAB environment itself:
adding the same directory to the list of directories that MATLAB searches
to find functions.  If <span class="placeholder">DIR</span> is the
directory where the libSBML shared library as well as
<code>TranslateSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>,
<code>OutputSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>, and
<code>CheckAndConvert.m</code> have been installed, then the following
MATLAB command must be executed:

<pre class="fragment">
addpath('<span class="placeholder">DIR</span>');
</pre>

<p> For example, suppose you are using an Intel-based Mac&nbsp;OS X system
and you have configured libSBML to install itself into
<code>/usr/local</code>.  Then the files
<code>TranslateSBML.mexmaci</code>, <code>OutputSBML.mexmaci</code>
and <code>CheckAndConvert.m</code>
will have been installed as
<code>/usr/local/lib/TranslateSBML.mexmaci</code>,
<code>/usr/local/lib/OutpuSBML.mexmaci</code> and
<code>/usr/local/lib/CheckAndConvert.m</code>.  You will need to set
your <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to
<code>/usr/local/lib</code>, and also execute the following command
(or an equivalent) in MATLAB:

<pre class="fragment">
addpath('/usr/local/lib');
</pre>

<p> To save the trouble of having to type the command above each
time you start MATLAB, you may wish to put it in your
<code>startup.m</code> file (i.e., the file MATLAB uses for user
initialization).  Please refer to the MATLAB documentation for more
information about <code>startup.m</code> and where it is located.


<h4>MATLAB on Windows systems</h4>

<p> Most Windows users will probably prefer to install libSBML using the
self-extracting installer provided separately and available for downloading
from the same servers as the libSBML source code distribution.  The
installer will take care of placing the MATLAB files in directories where
MATLAB can find them.  Nothing further needs to be done in that case.  You
should be able to start MATLAB at will, and be able to invoke functions
like <code>TranslateSBML</code> and <code>OutputSBML</code>.

<p> If you are compiling and installing libSBML from the sources, or else
want/need to install the MATLAB bindings directly from the libSBML source
distribution on Windows, follow these simple steps:

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Start MATLAB.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Within MATLAB, change directory to the
directory in your libSBML source tree containing the MATLAB code.  This
directory will be <code><span
class="placeholder">libsbml</span>/src/bindings/matlab</code>, where
<code><span class="placeholder">libsbml</span></code> is the root of your
libSBML source directory on your computer.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Execute <code>buildSBML</code> in MATLAB.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Execute <code>installSBML</code> in MATLAB.

</ol>

<p> After these steps, you should be able to invoke functions such as
<code>TranslateSBML</code> and <code>OutputSBML</code>.  These will be
accessible after you restart MATLAB and even when you are no longer in the
libSBML directory.

instructions</a>, we provide three ways for you to get the libSBML Python
language interface easily without having to configure and build libSBML
manually from sources.  You can use (1) <a target="_blank"
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, the Python Package Index; (2)
binary packages for use with standard Linux installation tools such as
<code>yum</code> and <code>apt-get</code>; or (3) executable installers for
Windows.

<h3>If you used a libSBML Python installer</h3>

<p> If you downloaded one of the <a
href="libsbml-downloading.html#dl-python">ready-to-use Python installers</a>
for libSBML, you should not need to do anything more: you should be able to
access libSBML from your Python interpreter by importing it like any other
Python module.  In other words, the following should work:

<pre class="fragment">
from libsbml import *
</pre>


<h3>If you did not use an installer</h3

<p> In this case, libSBML must first be configured, compiled and installed as
described in the <a href="libsbml-installation.html">building
instructions</a>.  Once that is done, your Python interpreter will need one
more thing to find libSBML: a correctly set <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
environment variable.  To cope with the fact that different Unix-like systems
(including Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X) use different conventions for where they
install Python modules, the following is a general-purpose setting for
<code>PYTHONPATH</code>.  Here, <span class="placeholder">DIR</span>
represents the value of the <nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span
class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span></nobr> option given during
configuration of libSBML (the default value is <code>/usr/local</code>) and
<span class="placeholder">version</span> is the version of your copy of
Python (this might be, e.g., <code>2.7</code>).  If you use <i>sh</i>-based
shells such as Bash, put this in your shell's initialization file or execute
it in your shell before starting the Python interpreter:

<pre class="fragment" style="font-size: 12px">
PYSITE=<span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/site-packages
PYDIST=<span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/dist-packages
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYSITE:$PYSITE/libsbml:$PYDIST:$PYDIST/libsbml
</pre>

If you use <i>csh</i>-based shells instead of Bash or other
<i>sh</i>-based shells, then the appropriate syntax is the following:

<pre class="fragment" style="font-size: 12px">
set PYSITE = <span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/site-packages
set PYDIST = <span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/dist-packages
setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:${PYSITE}:${PYSITE}/libsbml:${PYDIST}:${PYDIST}/libsbml
</pre>

<p> Once the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable has been set, you should be
able to start the Python interpreter and type the following command to
import the libSBML package for Python:

<pre class="fragment">
from libsbml import *
</pre>

<p>
If Python produces an import error or a failure in linking a new module, it
probably means that <code>PYTHONPATH</code> has not been set correctly.
It may also mean that the read/write permissions of the installed library
files or a directory in the hierarchy containing them are such that you are
not allowed to access the files.  In that case, please consult your systems
administrator or (if you have administrator priviledges) reset the
permissions yourself.

R</h2>
<p> As described in the <a href="libsbml-download.html#dl-r">downloading
instructions</a>, we provide ready-built installers for the libSBML R
language interface that you can download from our <a target="_blank"
href="http://github.com/sbmlteam/libsbml/releases/">GitHub download
page</a>.  If you use one of the installers, you do not need to do anything
more to set up and use libSBML for R on your system.

<p> Alternatively, you can also build the R bindings yourself following the
<a href="libsbml-installation.html">compilation instructions</a>.  If you do,
make sure to configure your CMake or GNU make build with the option to enable
the libSBML R interface.  Following the build, <strong>one more step is
required to make your R installation find the libSBML interface</strong>: you
must invoke a command in R, supplying it with the path to this archive file.
You can do this in one of two ways: either using the R graphical interface,
or a shell command.
<ul>
<li><em style="padding-right: 1px">Using the R GUI</em>: In the R menu
"<strong>Packages</strong>" or "<strong>Packages&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Data</strong>"
(depending on your operating system), select the "<strong>Package 
Installer</strong>" item.  You will be presented with an interface that lets
you install a local binary package.  Use the interface to navigate to the
directory where you copied the libSBML archive file, and select the archive
file for installation.

<li><em style="padding-right: 1px">Using a shell command</em>: 
Suppose that the path to the libSBML R archive on your computer is
<span class="placeholder">archive</span>.  Execute the following command
in a terminal/shell window (note: <em>not</em> in the R command line
interpreter!):

<pre class="fragment">
R CMD INSTALL <span class="placeholder">archive</span>
</pre>

<p> In the command above, <code>R</code> is the executable for the
command-line version of R; we assume it is accessible from your shell's
command line, but if it is not accessible by simply typing <code>R</code>, you
may need to supply the full path to <code>R</code>.
</ul>

<p> From this point forward, you should be able to call on libSBML functions
from within your copy of R.  You can test whether the installation was
successful by trying the following command in R:

<pre class="fragment">
library('libSBML')
</pre>

<p> If R does not report an error when you execute this command, then the
libSBML R interface is probably installed correctly.
